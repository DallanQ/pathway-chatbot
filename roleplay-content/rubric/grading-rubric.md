# Missionary Orientation Visit Grading Rubric

## Purpose and Overview

This rubric is designed to evaluate BYU-Pathway service missionaries' performance during new student orientation visits. The goal is to assess how effectively missionaries:
- Connect with and support prospective students
- Communicate clearly and compassionately
- Address concerns and provide accurate information
- Demonstrate cultural sensitivity and spiritual discernment
- Help students feel prepared and confident about PathwayConnect

The rubric uses a **combination scoring system**: each dimension receives both a **numeric score (1-5)** and a **qualitative level description** (Needs Improvement, Developing, Proficient, Exemplary).

## Grading Dimensions

### 1. Empathy & Active Listening

**What This Measures:**
The missionary's ability to recognize, acknowledge, and respond appropriately to the student's emotional state, concerns, and underlying needs. This includes active listening, validation of feelings, and empathetic responses.

#### Scoring Levels

**1 - Needs Significant Improvement**
- Fails to acknowledge student's concerns or emotions
- Interrupts or talks over the student
- Dismisses feelings with phrases like "Don't worry" or "You'll be fine" without addressing specific concerns
- Focuses on their own agenda without adapting to student's needs
- Doesn't ask clarifying questions or check for understanding
- **Example:** Student expresses fear about returning to school after 20 years; missionary responds: "Everyone says that, but PathwayConnect is easy. You'll be fine."

**2 - Developing**
- Acknowledges student's concerns superficially
- Listens but doesn't probe deeper or ask follow-up questions
- Provides generic reassurance without addressing specific fears
- Occasionally interrupts or shifts topic before student finishes
- Shows some awareness of emotions but doesn't validate them meaningfully
- **Example:** Student shares anxiety about being the slowest in class; missionary says: "I understand you're nervous. PathwayConnect has lots of support." [Doesn't explore the specific fear or provide targeted reassurance]

**3 - Proficient**
- Actively listens and lets student finish thoughts without interrupting
- Acknowledges and validates specific concerns the student raises
- Asks clarifying questions to better understand the student's situation
- Provides reassurance tied to the specific concerns mentioned
- Demonstrates understanding through paraphrasing or reflection
- **Example:** Student shares fear about technology; missionary responds: "It sounds like you're worried about navigating the online platform since you're not very comfortable with computers. That's completely understandable. Let me tell you about the technology support available..."

**4 - Exemplary**
- Demonstrates deep, attentive listening throughout the conversation
- Identifies both stated and unstated emotional needs (reads between the lines)
- Validates feelings before problem-solving
- Asks insightful follow-up questions that help student articulate concerns
- Adapts entire conversation approach based on student's emotional state
- Connects student's concerns to relevant support, resources, or stories
- Creates a safe, non-judgmental space for honest sharing
- **Example:** Student hesitantly mentions worries about failing; missionary picks up on deeper fear of inadequacy, validates the courage it took to enroll, shares story of another student with similar background who succeeded, and provides specific support systems available.

---

### 2. Clarity of Communication

**What This Measures:**
The missionary's ability to communicate information clearly, simply, and appropriately for the student's comprehension level. This includes avoiding jargon, adapting language for non-native English speakers or those unfamiliar with church/educational terminology, and confirming understanding.

#### Scoring Levels

**1 - Needs Significant Improvement**
- Uses complex, jargon-heavy language without explanation
- Doesn't check for student comprehension
- Speaks too quickly or uses long, convoluted sentences
- Fails to adapt communication style to student's language level or background
- Provides confusing or contradictory information
- **Example:** To a non-native English speaker: "You'll need to complete the ELA prerequisite before matriculating into PC101, unless your CEFR assessment indicates B2 proficiency, in which case you can bypass EnglishConnect 3 and proceed directly to enrollment."

**2 - Developing**
- Sometimes uses jargon or terminology without explaining it
- Checks for understanding occasionally but not consistently
- Communication is mostly clear but sometimes confusing or overly complex
- Adapts language somewhat but not fully to student's level
- Organizes information adequately but could be more structured
- **Example:** "You need to follow the honor code. It's about living church standards. It's not required now, but later it is." [Somewhat unclear about when and what]

**3 - Proficient**
- Uses simple, clear language appropriate to student's comprehension level
- Avoids or explains necessary jargon and terminology
- Checks for understanding periodically ("Does that make sense?" "Do you have questions?")
- Adapts communication style when student shows signs of confusion
- Organizes information logically
- Confirms key points at the end
- **Example:** "The honor code is a set of standards that BYU students follow, like not drinking alcohol or coffee. During PathwayConnect, you don't have to follow these rules. If you continue to the online degree program after PathwayConnect, then you would need to follow the honor code. Does that make sense?"

**4 - Exemplary**
- Communicates with exceptional clarity, using language perfectly suited to student's level
- Recognizes and immediately adapts when student shows any sign of confusion
- Proactively defines terms before they could cause confusion
- Uses concrete examples and analogies to explain abstract concepts
- Regularly checks for comprehension in natural, non-patronizing ways
- Summarizes key information at strategic points
- For language barriers: Slows down, simplifies sentence structure, uses visual aids or written follow-up if possible
- **Example:** With English language learner: [Speaks slowly] "Do you speak English?" [Student: "Little."] "Okay. I speak slowly. You need to take a test. A test for English. The test shows how much English you know. Then we know if you start PathwayConnect now, or take English class first. Do you understand?" [Waits for response, checks understanding]

---

### 3. Cultural Sensitivity

**What This Measures:**
The missionary's awareness of and respect for the student's cultural background, religious beliefs (particularly non-member students), socioeconomic situation, and life context. This includes avoiding assumptions, respecting different perspectives, and demonstrating cultural humility.

#### Scoring Levels

**1 - Needs Significant Improvement**
- Makes assumptions based on stereotypes or limited cultural knowledge
- Dismisses or minimizes cultural differences
- Insensitive to student's religious background (especially if non-member)
- Doesn't acknowledge socioeconomic challenges or treats them as excuses
- Uses language or examples that are culturally inappropriate or irrelevant
- Pressures non-member students to convert or implies membership is expected
- **Example:** To non-member student: "Well, if you're serious about education, you should really consider joining the church. It will help you get more out of PathwayConnect."

**2 - Developing**
- Shows basic awareness of cultural differences but doesn't deeply engage with them
- Occasionally makes assumptions without checking them
- Respectful of different backgrounds but doesn't actively incorporate cultural context into responses
- Acknowledges student's religion or culture when directly mentioned but doesn't explore further
- May inadvertently use examples or references that don't resonate culturally
- **Example:** To student from rural PNG: "You can use the online library resources—there are thousands of books!" [Doesn't consider potential limited internet access or unfamiliarity with online libraries]

**3 - Proficient**
- Demonstrates awareness and respect for student's cultural and religious background
- Avoids assumptions and asks clarifying questions about student's context
- Acknowledges challenges related to culture, language, or socioeconomic factors
- Respects non-member students' faith and clearly communicates they don't need to convert
- Uses inclusive language that doesn't assume LDS membership
- Tailors advice and resources to student's specific cultural context
- **Example:** To non-member student: "I want to be clear—you don't need to join the church to complete PathwayConnect. Your Catholic faith is respected and welcomed. The program is designed to help all students, regardless of their religious background. Do you have any questions about how your faith fits with the program?"

**4 - Exemplary**
- Demonstrates deep cultural humility and sophisticated awareness of cultural dynamics
- Actively seeks to understand student's unique cultural and religious context
- Adapts entire approach based on cultural considerations (communication style, pacing, formality)
- Proactively addresses potential cultural or religious concerns before they become barriers
- Validates and honors student's background while providing relevant information
- Recognizes and responds to socioeconomic realities with compassion and practical solutions
- For non-members: Clearly distinguishes between academic program and religious requirements; emphasizes inclusivity and respect
- **Example:** To non-member student from Ecuador: "I really appreciate you sharing that you're Catholic. That takes courage, and I want you to know that students from many different faith backgrounds succeed in PathwayConnect. The program is sponsored by the church, but it's designed to serve all students—your faith is valued and respected. You won't be asked to join the church or attend services. The focus is on education and life skills that align with your goals. Some course materials include spiritual content, but it's presented in a way that students from different faiths can engage with. Does that help clarify things?"

---

### 4. Scriptural/Spiritual Approach

**What This Measures:**
The missionary's ability to appropriately incorporate spiritual guidance, testimony, and scriptural principles in a way that uplifts and encourages the student without being preachy, inappropriate, or pushy. This includes spiritual discernment, knowing when and how to bear testimony, and connecting faith to the student's educational journey.

#### Scoring Levels

**1 - Needs Significant Improvement**
- Never mentions spiritual support or completely avoids spiritual dimension
- OR: Is overly preachy, pushy, or makes the conversation uncomfortably religious
- Bears testimony in a way that feels disconnected from the student's actual concerns
- Pressures student to have spiritual experiences or make religious commitments
- For non-members: Makes them feel they must convert or be more "spiritual" to succeed
- **Example:** "Before we talk about PathwayConnect, I want to share my testimony of the Restoration..." [Goes on for several minutes unrelated to student's needs]
- **OR:** Completely ignores the spiritual dimension of the program and treats it as purely academic.

**2 - Developing**
- Mentions spiritual support or testimony but in a generic, disconnected way
- Spiritual elements feel forced or inserted awkwardly
- Doesn't connect spiritual principles to student's specific situation
- May bear testimony but without clear relevance to the conversation
- For non-members: Acknowledges spiritual elements but doesn't clarify how non-members can engage with them
- **Example:** "I know PathwayConnect is inspired by God. The church leaders really care about education. Anyway, do you have questions?"

**3 - Proficient**
- Appropriately incorporates spiritual elements in a natural, relevant way
- Bears testimony in response to specific student concerns or as encouragement
- Connects spiritual principles to the student's educational journey and challenges
- Mentions available spiritual support (missionaries, prayer, scriptures) when appropriate
- For non-members: Acknowledges spiritual dimension while respecting their faith background
- Balances spiritual guidance with practical information
- **Example:** "I can tell you're really worried about whether you can do this. I want you to know that I believe Heavenly Father will help you as you work hard and seek His guidance. You don't have to face this alone—spiritually or practically. There are missionaries who will check in with you, and you can pray for help. I know that sounds simple, but I've seen it make a real difference for students like you."

**4 - Exemplary**
- Demonstrates spiritual discernment in knowing when, how, and how much to share spiritual guidance
- Bears testimony in a powerful yet humble way that directly addresses student's fears or needs
- Connects spiritual principles to practical challenges in meaningful, personalized ways
- Invites student to draw on their own faith and spiritual resources
- For non-members: Honors their spiritual journey while offering relevant spiritual principles respectfully
- Balances warmth and conviction with complete respect for student's agency
- Creates space for spiritual connection without pressure
- **Example:** To adult learner: "Katra, I want to share something with you. You mentioned feeling like you're not smart enough, but I've learned that intelligence isn't just about schoolwork—it's about the wisdom and capability you've developed over 25 years of serving people and solving problems. I believe Heavenly Father sees those gifts in you. The scriptures talk about how God qualifies those He calls. You felt prompted to enroll—that wasn't random. I don't think He would inspire you to do something and then leave you to fail. As you move forward, I encourage you to pray for help when you're struggling, to trust that you have divine support, and to remember that this journey is about becoming, not just about grades. Does that resonate with you?"

### 5. Accuracy of Information

**What This Measures:**
The missionary's knowledge of PathwayConnect policies, procedures, requirements, and resources, and their ability to provide correct, complete information to the student. This includes knowing when to say "I don't know" and knowing where to direct students for additional help.

#### Scoring Levels

**1 - Needs Significant Improvement**
- Provides incorrect information about program requirements, honor code, costs, or other key details
- Makes up answers instead of admitting uncertainty
- Contradicts official program policies
- Fails to address the student's actual question
- Doesn't provide contact information or resources for follow-up
- **Example:** "Oh, the honor code? Yeah, everyone has to follow that starting immediately." [Incorrect—honor code doesn't apply during PathwayConnect]

**2 - Developing**
- Provides mostly correct information but with some gaps or minor inaccuracies
- May be vague or uncertain about specific policies
- Addresses some of the student's questions but misses key points
- Provides limited resources or doesn't follow up on unclear areas
- Sometimes gives incomplete answers without acknowledging gaps
- **Example:** Student asks about English Language Assessment; missionary says: "I think there's a test you might need to take, but I'm not sure when or how." [Vague, doesn't provide concrete next steps]

**3 - Proficient**
- Provides accurate, complete information about program requirements and policies
- Clearly distinguishes between PathwayConnect and online degree program (including when honor code applies)
- Acknowledges when they don't know something and commits to finding out
- Provides appropriate resources, contact information, and next steps
- Answers the student's actual questions directly
- **Example:** "Great question. The honor code is a set of standards that students commit to, like abstaining from alcohol, coffee, and tea, and living moral standards aligned with church teachings. But here's the important part: the honor code only applies when you move to the online degree program after PathwayConnect. During PathwayConnect itself, you don't have to sign or follow the honor code. If you decide not to continue to the degree program, you never have to commit to it. Does that answer your question?"

**4 - Exemplary**
- Provides exceptionally accurate, detailed, and complete information
- Anticipates related questions and proactively addresses them
- Clearly explains complex policies in understandable terms
- Knows exactly where to direct students for specific needs (tech support, financial help, language resources, etc.)
- Follows up to ensure student received needed information
- Corrects any misunderstandings the student may have from previous sources
- **Example:** "I want to make sure I give you complete information about the honor code because I know there's confusion about this. During PathwayConnect, the honor code does not apply—you won't sign it, and you're not required to follow it. If you complete PathwayConnect and want to continue to an online degree program—like a bachelor's in Business Management—that's when the honor code becomes a requirement. At that point, you'd commit to living standards like not drinking alcohol, tea, or coffee, dressing modestly, being honest, and living moral standards. This applies to all degree students, regardless of whether they're members of the church. But again, that's only for the degree program, not PathwayConnect. If you do PathwayConnect and decide not to continue, you never have to commit to the honor code. Here's a link to the full honor code if you want to read it: [provides link]. Do you have other questions about this or anything else?"

### 6. Problem Resolution & Next Steps

**What This Measures:**
The missionary's ability to help the student move forward constructively. This includes identifying actionable next steps, providing concrete resources, connecting students with appropriate support, and helping students feel prepared and confident (or appropriately redirected if needed).

#### Scoring Levels

**1 - Needs Significant Improvement**
- Ends conversation without clear next steps or action items
- Doesn't address the student's primary concern or barrier
- Fails to provide resources or contacts for follow-up
- Leaves student more confused or uncertain than before the conversation
- Doesn't offer to help or connect student with additional support
- **Example:** Conversation ends: "Okay, good luck with PathwayConnect! Bye!" [Student still doesn't know they need to take English Language Assessment or what to do next]

**2 - Developing**
- Provides vague or generic next steps ("Check your email," "Log into the portal")
- Addresses some of the student's concerns but leaves key issues unresolved
- Offers limited resources or contacts
- Next steps are unclear or not actionable
- Doesn't confirm student feels prepared to move forward
- **Example:** "So, you should take the English test and then see what happens. You can find it online somewhere. Let me know if you have questions." [Vague, not actionable]

**3 - Proficient**
- Identifies clear, specific next steps for the student
- Addresses the student's primary concerns before ending the conversation
- Provides concrete resources (links, contact information, documents)
- Offers to follow up or connect student with additional support if needed
- Confirms student understands what to do next
- Helps student feel more prepared and confident than at the start
- **Example:** "Okay, let's make sure you're clear on next steps. First, you'll take the English Language Assessment—here's the link: [provides link]. It should take about 30 minutes. After you complete it, the results will tell us whether you can start PathwayConnect now or if you should take EnglishConnect 3 first to build your English skills. I'm going to follow up with you by email with this link and instructions in Portuguese so you have everything written down. If you have any trouble or questions, you can reach me at [contact info], or you can contact the PathwayConnect support team at [contact]. Does that sound clear?"

**4 - Exemplary**
- Co-creates a clear, actionable plan with the student
- Addresses all student concerns and barriers before ending
- Provides comprehensive, personalized resources and contacts
- Connects student with specific people or support systems (mentors, peers, language support, etc.)
- For students who should withdraw/delay: Handles this compassionately and provides alternative pathways
- Confirms student feels confident and prepared (or appropriately supported if concerns remain)
- Follows up in writing with summary and resources
- **Example:** "Katra, I can tell you're still nervous, and that's completely okay. Let me make sure you have everything you need. First, I'm going to connect you with another student named David who also came to PathwayConnect after many years away from school. He's from PNG too and completed the program last year. I think talking to him will really help you see that this is possible. Second, I'm sending you a link to a short video that shows what a typical PathwayConnect class looks like—it'll help you see it's not as scary as you're imagining. Third, when you start, you'll be assigned a missionary mentor who will check in with you weekly. I'm going to let them know you're especially worried about study skills, so they can give you extra support in that area. And fourth, my contact info is [contact]—please reach out anytime, even just to talk through your fears. You're not alone in this. Before we end, is there anything else you need from me right now?"

### For Missionaries
This rubric is designed to help you understand what excellent orientation visits look like. Use it to:
- Self-assess your conversations
- Identify specific areas for improvement
- Understand what "good" looks like in each dimension
- Prepare for orientation visits by reviewing the "Exemplary" descriptions

---

## Advice Generation Guidelines

After scoring a conversation, generate **1-3 specific, actionable pieces of advice** prioritized by impact. Advice should:

### Characteristics of Good Advice
1. **Specific:** Not "Be more empathetic," but "When the student expresses fear, validate the feeling before problem-solving. For example: 'It makes complete sense that you'd feel nervous about returning to school after 20 years.'"

2. **Actionable:** The missionary should know exactly what to do differently next time

3. **Prioritized:** Focus on the 1-3 most impactful improvements, not a laundry list

4. **Connected to Student Outcome:** Explain why this matters for the student's experience

5. **Strengths-Based When Possible:** Acknowledge what went well, then build on it

### Priority Order for Advice
1. **Critical Gaps:** If a student's core concern was not addressed, this is top priority
2. **Cultural/Spiritual Missteps:** Insensitivity or inappropriate spiritual pressure
3. **Clarity Issues:** If student likely didn't understand key information
4. **Empathy Opportunities:** Missed chances to validate and support
5. **Refinements:** Ways to move from proficient to exemplary

### Example Advice Outputs

**Example 1: Conversation with Jorge (Non-member with honor code concerns)**

*Scores: Empathy: 3, Clarity: 4, Cultural Sensitivity: 2, Spiritual: 3, Accuracy: 4, Problem Resolution: 3*

**Advice:**
1. **Proactively address non-member concerns with greater cultural sensitivity (Cultural Sensitivity: 2 → 4).** While you did eventually clarify that Jorge doesn't need to convert, you waited for him to bring up his anxiety about being Catholic. In future conversations with non-member students, proactively acknowledge their faith background early and clearly state: "Students from many faith backgrounds succeed in PathwayConnect—your Catholic faith is valued and respected." This helps non-members feel welcomed from the start rather than worrying they'll need to convert.

2. **Validate concerns before providing solutions (Empathy: 3 → 4).** When Jorge expressed worry about the honor code, you immediately explained the policy, which was helpful. However, you could strengthen this by first validating his concern: "I'm really glad you asked about this—it's a completely reasonable question, and I can see why it would worry you." Then provide the information. This small shift helps students feel heard and understood, not just informed.

3. **Strengthen: Your clarity in explaining the honor code was excellent.** You used simple language, distinguished between PathwayConnect and the degree program, and checked for understanding. Continue this approach—it's exactly what students need.

---

**Example 2: Conversation with Katra (Adult learner with low confidence)**

*Scores: Empathy: 4, Clarity: 3, Cultural Sensitivity: 3, Spiritual: 4, Accuracy: 3, Problem Resolution: 2*

**Advice:**
1. **Provide concrete next steps and specific support connections (Problem Resolution: 2 → 4).** You did a beautiful job validating Katra's fears and bearing testimony about divine help. However, you ended the conversation without giving him tangible resources to feel less alone—like connecting him with a peer mentor, providing a contact for weekly check-ins, or showing him a video of what a class looks like. Katra's fear is overwhelming, so he needs *both* spiritual reassurance *and* practical support structures. Next time, end with: "I'm going to connect you with [specific person] who..." and "Here's exactly what support you'll have: ..."

2. **Connect his work experience to academic capability (Empathy: 4 → 4+).** You validated Katra's fears beautifully, but you could go further by helping him reframe his beliefs about intelligence. Point out: "Managing a hotel shift, training employees, and solving guest problems requires critical thinking, communication, and time management—those are the exact skills PathwayConnect teaches. You already have them; you're just going to learn to apply them in new ways." This helps combat his belief that he's "not smart enough."

3. **Strengthen: Your spiritual approach was exceptional.** Your testimony about God qualifying those He calls directly addressed Katra's core fear and was delivered with warmth and humility. This is exactly the kind of spiritual support that can sustain a student through hard moments.

---

## Conclusion

This rubric is a tool for growth, not judgment. The goal is to help BYU-Pathway missionaries conduct orientation visits that leave students feeling:
- **Heard and understood**
- **Informed and clear about next steps**
- **Respected and valued, regardless of background**
- **Spiritually supported and encouraged**
- **Confident and prepared to begin (or appropriately redirected if needed)**

When missionaries excel across these six dimensions, students are far more likely to persist in PathwayConnect and succeed in their educational and spiritual journeys.
