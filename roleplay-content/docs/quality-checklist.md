## Section 1: Research Foundation & Authenticity

### Research Quality

- [ ] **Regional Research Conducted:** Creator has researched the specific country/region, including cultural norms, economic conditions, educational landscape, and LDS church presence
- [ ] **Cultural Consultation (if applicable):** If creating a persona from a culture the creator is not part of, input has been sought from someone from that culture or extensive research has been conducted
- [ ] **Current Information:** All facts about the region, church presence, educational systems, etc. are current and accurate (not outdated)
- [ ] **Citations Available:** Creator can provide sources for cultural, economic, or educational claims if requested

### Authenticity

- [ ] **Feels Like a Real Person:** Persona reads like a real individual with depth, complexity, and humanity (not a flat character or caricature)
- [ ] **Specific Details:** Background includes concrete, specific details (job title, family structure, neighborhood type, etc.) rather than vague generalities
- [ ] **Internal Consistency:** All elements of the persona are consistent with each other (e.g., age, education level, career trajectory, life events make sense together)

### Socioeconomic Sensitivity

## Quick Reference: Most Common Issues

Based on experience, these are the most common issues found during quality review:

1. **Vague Concerns:** Persona's worries are too general ("worried about the program") instead of specific ("worried about being required to follow honor code")

2. **Stereotypical Cultural Representation:** Persona relies on cultural stereotypes instead of researched, nuanced cultural context

3. **One-Dimensional Emotion:** Persona only shows one emotion (e.g., only fear, only excitement) instead of realistic emotional complexity

4. **Info-Dumping in System Prompt:** System prompt doesn't sufficiently warn LLM against listing entire backstory at once

5. **Missing Language Constraints:** For limited English personas, system prompt doesn't provide specific enough vocabulary/grammar limitations

6. **Unclear Training Value:** Can't clearly articulate what missionary skills this persona is designed to test

7. **Too Easy or Too Hard:** Persona is either too simple (any generic response works) or too complex/impossible (no good response possible)

8. **Insufficient Testing:** Persona approved without actually testing with LLM in conversation

9. **Cultural Facts Not Verified:** Claims about region, culture, economy, etc. are based on assumptions rather than research

10. **Lack of Specificity:** Too many generalities; not enough concrete, specific details that make person feel real

---

## Conclusion

Every persona must pass this quality checklist before being approved for use in missionary training. The checklist ensures:
- **Authenticity** - Personas feel like real people missionaries might meet
- **Respect** - Cultural, religious, socioeconomic, and linguistic representation is dignified
- **Training Value** - Personas effectively help missionaries develop critical skills
- **Functionality** - Personas work technically when embodied by LLMs

Take this quality assurance process seriously. These personas represent real students' real challenges and will shape how missionaries learn to serve. Quality, respect, and authenticity matter.
