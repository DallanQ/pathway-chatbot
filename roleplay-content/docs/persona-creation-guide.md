# Persona Creation Guide for BYU-Pathway Role-Play Training

## Purpose

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating additional student personas for the BYU-Pathway missionary role-play training system. The initial personas (Jorge, Katra, and Vitoria) serve as models, but the program needs 6-12+ personas representing diverse student challenges, regions, and backgrounds to provide comprehensive missionary training.

---

## Overview of the Persona System

### What Are These Personas?

These personas are detailed, realistic character profiles representing prospective BYU-Pathway students that missionaries will encounter during new student orientation visits. Each persona is designed to:

1. **Embody a specific common challenge or concern** that students face (e.g., honor code confusion, low confidence, language barriers, technology challenges, family obligations)
2. **Represent authentic regional, cultural, and demographic backgrounds** from BYU-Pathway's global student population
3. **Provide realistic conversation practice** for missionaries in a safe, repeatable training environment
4. **Test specific missionary skills** (empathy, clarity, cultural sensitivity, spiritual discernment, etc.)

### Components of Each Persona

Each complete persona consists of:

1. **Persona Description Document** (4-5 paragraphs in markdown)
   - Background and life story
   - Personality and communication style
   - Current emotional state and concerns
   - Cultural and regional context
   - Family dynamics (if relevant)

2. **System Prompt Template** (detailed prompt for LLM to embody the persona)
   - Role and context
   - Background internalization
   - Primary concerns
   - Communication style guidelines
   - Response examples and behavioral rules

---

## Step-by-Step Persona Creation Process

### Step 1: Identify the Student Challenge/Issue

**Goal:** Determine what specific challenge or concern this persona will represent.

**Sources for Identifying Challenges:**
- **Qualitative research reports** on PathwayConnect student experiences
- **Missionary feedback** about common orientation visit challenges
- **New Student Orientation materials** at missionary.byupathway.org
- **PathwayConnect retention data** showing why students withdraw or struggle
- **Regional service center reports** about student needs in specific areas

**Common Student Challenges to Consider:**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Religious/Cultural** | Non-member with honor code concerns (Jorge-type), Muslim student, Hindu student, inactive member, recent convert, religious family opposition |
| **Academic Confidence** | Adult learner with low confidence (Katra-type), failed previous education, learning disability, first-generation student, impostor syndrome |
| **Language/Literacy** | Limited English (Vitoria-type), preliterate student, dyslexia, second-language even in native language |
| **Technology** | No computer access, no internet, technophobia, never used video conferencing, smartphone-only |
| **Socioeconomic** | Extreme poverty, working 3 jobs, no time for study, family breadwinner, caring for sick relatives |
| **Family/Social** | Unsupportive spouse, family obligations, single parent, too many children, community stigma about education |
| **Geographic/Access** | Rural with no internet, refugee/displaced, nomadic community, lives in area with no church support |
| **Age** | Very young (18-19, immature), very old (60+, fear of being too old), mid-life crisis (40s, questioning) |
| **Gender** | Cultural barriers for women's education, male in female-dominated field, non-traditional gender roles |
| **Mental Health** | Anxiety, depression (undiagnosed), trauma, grief, addiction recovery |

**Decision Criteria:**
- **High Impact:** Does this challenge affect many students or significantly impact retention?
- **Training Value:** Does addressing this challenge require specific missionary skills that need practice?
- **Diversity:** Does this persona add demographic, regional, or issue diversity to the existing set?
- **Realism:** Is this based on real student data, not hypothetical?

**Output:** Write 1-2 sentences defining the persona's core challenge.
- Example: "This persona represents a young female student in West Africa whose family opposes her education and who is navigating cultural expectations about marriage and women's roles while trying to pursue PathwayConnect."

---

### Step 2: Choose Demographic and Regional Details

**Goal:** Create authentic demographic and geographic context for the persona.

**Consider:**

1. **Region/Country:**
   - Choose from BYU-Pathway's active regions: Latin America, Africa (West/East/Southern), Pacific Islands, Asia, Eastern Europe, North America
   - Ensure geographic diversity across your full persona set (don't create 5 personas all from Brazil)

2. **Age:**
   - PathwayConnect students range from 18-65+
   - Consider how age intersects with the challenge (e.g., older adult learners have different confidence issues than young students)

3. **Gender:**
   - Ensure balanced representation
   - Consider how gender intersects with cultural expectations in the chosen region

4. **Religious Background:**
   - Active LDS member, less-active member, recent convert, non-member (friend of church), non-member (no previous church contact)
   - Other faiths: Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, animist, secular

5. **Family Situation:**
   - Single, married, children (how many? ages?), extended family living situation
   - Consider caregiver responsibilities

6. **Educational Background:**
   - Primary school only, some secondary, completed secondary, some university, university dropout
   - Years since last formal education

7. **Employment:**
   - Unemployed, underemployed, informal economy, manual labor, service industry, professional
   - Hours per week, income level, stability

8. **Language:**
   - Native language, English proficiency level (if not native English speaker)
   - Literacy level in native language

**Output:** Create a demographic profile table.

Example:
```
Name: Amara
Age: 35
Gender: Female
Location: Lagos, Nigeria
Religious Background: Less-active LDS member (baptized 5 years ago, hasn't attended church regularly in 2 years)
Family: Married with 4 children (ages 3-12), husband is not supportive of her education
Educational Background: Completed secondary school 17 years ago
Employment: Sells fabric at local market, informal economy, inconsistent income
Language: Yoruba (native), English (conversational but not strong in academic English)
Primary Challenge: Unsupportive spouse + time constraints + financial instability
```

---

### Step 3: Develop the Life Story and Background

**Goal:** Create a rich, authentic background that explains who this person is and how they arrived at this moment.

**Questions to Answer:**

1. **Where did they grow up?** (Rural village? Urban slum? Middle-class neighborhood?)
2. **What was their family like growing up?** (Parents' education, occupation, values, challenges)
3. **What happened with their education?** (Why did they stop? What were the barriers?)
4. **What have they been doing since leaving school?** (Work history, major life events)
5. **How did they encounter the church/gospel?** (Conversion story, family tradition, friend invitation)
6. **Why did they enroll in PathwayConnect?** (What motivated them? What are they hoping for?)
7. **What's changed between enrollment and now?** (Why are they having second thoughts or concerns?)

**Research for Authenticity:**
- Read qualitative interviews with real students from this region
- Understand economic and social realities of the country/region
- Learn about cultural values, family structures, gender roles
- Understand educational system and employment landscape
- Research church presence and dynamics in the region

**Writing Tips:**
- Use specific details (e.g., "works as a security guard at a hotel" not "has a job")
- Include sensory and emotional details that make the person feel real
- Connect their past experiences to their current concerns
- Show their strengths and capabilities, not just their challenges
- Avoid stereotypes or caricatures

**Output:** Write 2-3 paragraphs of background and life story.

---

### Step 4: Define Personality and Communication Style

**Goal:** Describe how this person talks, behaves, and interacts in conversations.

**Consider:**

1. **Personality Traits:**
   - Introverted vs. extroverted
   - Anxious vs. confident
   - Direct vs. indirect
   - Optimistic vs. pessimistic
   - Humble vs. assertive

2. **Communication Patterns:**
   - Verbose or brief responses?
   - Formal or casual language?
   - Expressive or reserved emotionally?
   - Asks many questions or gives short answers?
   - Comfortable with silence or needs to fill gaps?

3. **Cultural Communication Norms:**
   - How does their culture approach authority figures?
   - How directly do people express disagreement or concerns in their culture?
   - What role does formality, respect, or deference play?
   - How is emotion expressed (or not expressed)?

4. **Language Constraints (if applicable):**
   - If limited English: What's their proficiency level (A1/A2/B1)?
   - What specific vocabulary do they know vs. not know?
   - What grammatical errors are typical?

5. **Specific Phrases or Patterns:**
   - Do they apologize frequently?
   - Do they use qualifiers ("maybe," "I think," "I'm not sure")?
   - Do they ask permission to ask questions?
   - What phrases would they use authentically?

**Output:** Write 1-2 paragraphs describing personality and communication style.

---

### Step 5: Articulate Current Concerns and Emotional State

**Goal:** Clearly define what's worrying this person right now and what they're hoping to get from this orientation conversation.

**Questions to Answer:**

1. **What specific questions or concerns do they have?**
   - List 3-7 specific questions they need answered
   - Example: "Do I need to follow the honor code?" "Will I be able to afford this?" "What if my family finds out?"

2. **What emotions are they experiencing?**
   - Fear, anxiety, excitement, hope, shame, confusion, frustration, determination?
   - How intensely?

3. **What's the underlying fear or need?**
   - Beyond the surface concern, what's the deeper issue?
   - Example: Surface = "I don't have a computer." Deep = "I'm afraid of being left behind by technology and looking stupid."

4. **What are they hoping will happen in this conversation?**
   - Reassurance? Clarity? Permission to quit? Practical solutions? Validation?

5. **What's at stake for them?**
   - What do they stand to gain or lose?
   - Why does this matter so much?

**Writing Tips:**
- Be specific about concerns (not "worried about the program" but "worried that the honor code means I have to convert")
- Show the emotional complexity (excitement AND fear, hope AND doubt)
- Connect concerns to their background and life story

**Output:** Write 1-2 paragraphs on current emotional state and specific concerns.

---

### Step 6: Add Cultural and Regional Context

**Goal:** Ensure the persona is culturally authentic and grounded in real regional dynamics.

**What to Include:**

1. **Cultural Values:**
   - What values shape this person's worldview? (Collectivism vs. individualism, family honor, respect for elders, gender roles, religious duty, education as status)

2. **Regional Realities:**
   - Economic conditions (unemployment rate, cost of living, informal economy)
   - Educational landscape (literacy rates, access, quality, gender disparities)
   - Technology access (internet penetration, smartphone vs. computer ownership, connectivity issues)
   - Church presence (strong wards/stakes vs. isolated branches, missionary activity, member demographics)

3. **Socioeconomic Context:**
   - What class or caste does this person belong to?
   - What are the economic pressures they face?
   - How does education function as social mobility (or not)?

4. **Cultural Attitudes Toward Education:**
   - Is higher education valued, expected, rare, stigmatized?
   - Are there gender, age, or class norms about who "should" pursue education?

5. **Specific Cultural Challenges:**
   - For this persona's specific situation, what cultural dynamics make their challenge harder?
   - Example: In some cultures, married women pursuing education face social stigma

**Research Sources:**
- Country/region Wikipedia pages (demographics, education, economy)
- LDS Church newsroom articles about the region
- Qualitative research reports
- YouTube videos about daily life in the region
- Academic articles about education in the country

**Output:** Write 1-2 paragraphs on cultural and regional context.

**Output:** Complete system prompt markdown file saved as `prompts/[name]-system-prompt.md`

---

## Step 9: Test and Refine the Persona

**Goal:** Validate that the persona is realistic, useful for training, and technically functional.

### Testing Process:

1. **Use the system prompt with an LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and conduct a test conversation**
   - Play the role of a missionary
   - Ask typical orientation questions
   - See if the persona behaves authentically

2. **Check for:**
   - Does the persona feel realistic and respectful (not stereotypical)?
   - Does the persona present appropriate challenges for missionaries to practice?
   - Does the persona stay in character throughout?
   - Are the concerns clearly articulated?
   - Does the communication style match the description?

3. **Refine based on testing:**
   - If the persona is too easy to help: Make concerns more complex or add additional layers
   - If the persona is unrealistic: Adjust communication style, background, or motivations
   - If the persona breaks character: Add more specific behavioral guidelines to the system prompt
   - If the conversation feels forced: Revise personality to be more natural

4. **Get Feedback:**
   - Share with actual BYU-Pathway missionaries or administrators
   - Ask: "Does this feel like a real student you'd encounter?"
   - Incorporate feedback to improve authenticity

**Output:** Refined persona description and system prompt based on testing.

---

## Step 10: Document and Add to Library

**Goal:** Integrate the new persona into the training system.

### Final Steps:

1. **Save files in appropriate directories:**
   - `personas/[name].md`
   - `prompts/[name]-system-prompt.md`

2. **Update persona inventory document** (create a master list):
   - Persona name
   - Primary challenge/issue
   - Region/demographic
   - Difficulty level (easy/medium/hard for missionaries)
   - Recommended use (beginner training, advanced practice, specific skill focus)

3. **Create usage notes:**
   - What missionary skills does this persona test?
   - What are the ideal missionary responses?
   - What are common mistakes missionaries make with this persona?

## Ethical Considerations

### Respect and Dignity

1. **Avoid Stereotypes:**
   - Don't reduce people to caricatures based on nationality, religion, class, or education level
   - Ensure each persona is a fully realized individual with dignity

2. **Cultural Humility:**
   - Acknowledge when you're writing about a culture you're not part of
   - Seek input from people from that culture when possible
   - Research thoroughly; don't make assumptions

3. **Language Representation:**
   - If creating a persona with limited English, represent it respectfully
   - Don't make language barriers comedic or demeaning
   - Consult resources on authentic second-language speech patterns

4. **Trauma and Hardship:**
   - If including challenging circumstances (poverty, trauma, abuse), handle with sensitivity
   - Don't sensationalize suffering
   - Focus on the person's strength and agency, not just their victimhood

5. **Religious Respect:**
   - If creating non-member personas, represent their faith backgrounds respectfully
   - Don't imply that their concerns about church-sponsored education are unfounded or silly
   - Avoid proselytizing tone in persona descriptions

---

## Conclusion

Creating high-quality, authentic personas requires research, empathy, cultural awareness, and attention to detail. Each persona should feel like a real person—someone a missionary might actually meet—and should provide valuable training in specific skills.

By following this guide, you'll create a diverse library of personas that prepare missionaries to serve PathwayConnect students with empathy, clarity, cultural sensitivity, and spiritual discernment.

**Remember:** These personas represent real students' real challenges. Treat them with the dignity and respect that real students deserve.
