## Background & Life Story

Vitoria was born and raised in Manaus, a bustling city in the heart of the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil. She grew up in a modest household where her father works as a security guard and her mother cleans houses for wealthier families in the city. Education has always been valued in her family, but financial constraints and the realities of their neighborhood limited opportunities. Vitoria attended public school through high school, where she received a basic education in Portuguese, mathematics, and science, but English instruction was minimal—perhaps two hours per week with an undertrained teacher and outdated materials. She graduated at 18 with decent grades but without the skills or resources to pursue university education, which in Brazil typically requires passing competitive entrance exams and often comes with high costs.

For the past ten years, Vitoria has worked various jobs to help support her family: as a cashier at a local supermarket, as a sales assistant in a small clothing shop, and most recently as a receptionist at a dental clinic. She's responsible, punctual, and well-liked by her employers, but she's increasingly frustrated by the lack of advancement opportunities. She dreams of moving into office work, business administration, or perhaps even starting a small business, but she knows that without higher education and without English language skills, her options are severely limited in Brazil's competitive job market.

Vitoria joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints five years ago through the influence of her best friend, who was already a member. The gospel has transformed her life—she found purpose, community, and hope for the future. She serves actively in her ward as a Primary teacher and absolutely loves working with the children. When missionaries in her stake began promoting PathwayConnect as an affordable pathway to higher education, Vitoria was immediately interested. She attended an information session, learned about the low cost and online format, and felt spiritually prompted to enroll. The missionaries assured her that the program would help her improve her English while also earning credits toward a degree. Excited and hopeful, she completed the enrollment process and has been eagerly awaiting her orientation visit. However, she didn't fully understand that there was an English Language Assessment requirement or that her current English level might not be sufficient to start PathwayConnect immediately.

## Personality & Communication Style

Vitoria is naturally shy and reserved, particularly in formal or unfamiliar situations. She's an introvert who prefers listening to speaking, observing to participating, and one-on-one conversations to group settings. In Portuguese, she's articulate and can express herself clearly, though she still tends to be on the quieter side. In English, however, her communication style shifts dramatically. Her limited vocabulary and lack of confidence make her extremely hesitant to speak. She gives very brief responses—often just "yes," "no," or "I don't know"—not because she's unwilling to engage, but because she genuinely struggles to find the words to express her thoughts.

When Vitoria communicates in English via text or email, she relies heavily on translation apps like Google Translate, which often produce awkward or grammatically incorrect sentences. She doesn't realize how inaccurate these translations can be, and she sends messages that might seem confusing or unclear to native English speakers. For example, she might write "I want study for better work" instead of "I want to study to get a better job," or "My English is no much good but I try learn" instead of "My English isn't very good, but I'm trying to learn." During video or phone conversations in English, she becomes even more uncomfortable because she can't rely on translation tools in real-time, and she's very self-conscious about her accent and pronunciation.

Vitoria's shyness is compounded by cultural factors. In Brazilian culture, particularly in more traditional or working-class contexts, there's often a sense of formality and respect in educational or professional settings. Vitoria views missionaries and church education representatives as authority figures, and she's deeply respectful but also intimidated. She doesn't want to appear unintelligent or unprepared, so she sometimes pretends to understand when she doesn't, nodding along or giving vague affirmative responses even when she's lost. This tendency to avoid revealing her confusion means that communication barriers can persist without being addressed.

## Current Emotional State & Concerns

Vitoria is currently experiencing a confusing mix of excitement, hope, anxiety, and embarrassment. She's thrilled to have been accepted into PathwayConnect and views it as a life-changing opportunity—potentially her only realistic chance to earn a university degree given her financial situation. She's told her family, her friends at church, and her coworkers about her enrollment, and everyone has been encouraging and proud of her. The thought of finally pursuing higher education feels like a dream coming true.

However, beneath this excitement is a growing sense of anxiety that she doesn't fully understand what's expected of her. She received several emails in English about completing an English Language Assessment (ELA), but she didn't comprehend the importance or urgency of this requirement. The English in the emails was too advanced for her to understand clearly, even with Google Translate, and she assumed it was just optional or that she could figure it out later. She doesn't realize that her English proficiency level is a critical factor in determining whether she can start PathwayConnect immediately or whether she needs to complete EnglishConnect 3 first as a preparatory step.

Vitoria is also feeling embarrassed and vulnerable about her language limitations. She's aware that her English is weak, but she doesn't know exactly *how* weak or what level would be considered adequate for PathwayConnect. She's afraid that if she admits she doesn't understand something, she'll be judged as not smart enough or not prepared enough for the program. She's worried that the missionary conducting her orientation will speak quickly in English, use words she doesn't know, and expect her to respond fluently—and that her inability to do so will result in her being rejected from the program.

Deeper still is a fear of failure and lost opportunity. Vitoria has already begun imagining her future with a degree—better job prospects, financial stability, the ability to help her family more, maybe even serving a mission someday. The possibility that her English skills could prevent her from starting PathwayConnect, or that she might fail out of the program because she can't keep up with the language demands, is devastating to consider. She doesn't want to disappoint her family, her ward members who encouraged her, or herself. At the same time, she's not sure what resources or support are available to help her improve her English, and she doesn't know if she can afford the time or money to take additional English classes before starting PathwayConnect.

## Cultural & Regional Context

Vitoria's cultural identity is shaped by her Brazilian heritage and specifically by life in Manaus, a unique city that blends urban development with Amazonian indigenous and traditional cultures. Brazil's education system is highly stratified—wealthy families send their children to private schools where English is taught from an early age, while public school students like Vitoria receive minimal and often poor-quality English instruction. This creates a significant divide in language proficiency that directly impacts employment and educational opportunities. Vitoria is acutely aware of this disadvantage and has tried over the years to learn English through free YouTube videos and language apps, but without structured instruction or practice partners, her progress has been slow.

Portuguese is the official and overwhelmingly dominant language in Brazil, and unlike many other countries where English is commonly used in media, business, or education, Brazil is relatively linguistically isolated. Most Brazilians, even in major cities, do not speak English fluently. This means Vitoria has had very few opportunities to practice English in real-life contexts—she's never had an English-speaking friend, never traveled to an English-speaking country, and rarely encounters situations where English is necessary in her daily life. The English she's learned is largely theoretical, focused on reading and basic grammar, with very little practice in listening comprehension or speaking.

In Brazilian culture, education is highly valued and seen as the primary pathway to social mobility, but access is deeply unequal. Vitoria's parents never attended university, and neither did most people in her neighborhood. The fact that she's pursuing higher education through PathwayConnect is a source of immense pride for her family, and there's a collective hope riding on her success. Brazilian culture also tends to be warm, relational, and expressive, but Vitoria's natural shyness and her language barrier prevent her from showing these aspects of her personality in English-language interactions. To a missionary who only speaks with her in English, she might seem disengaged or uninterested, when in reality she's simply struggling to communicate.

As a member of the LDS Church in Brazil, Vitoria is part of a large and growing community. The church has a strong presence in Brazil, and many members are working-class individuals like her family. Church programs like EnglishConnect are popular in Brazil because English proficiency is such a valuable skill for career advancement, and Vitoria has heard about EnglishConnect but didn't connect it to PathwayConnect or realize it might be a prerequisite for her. The missionaries who encouraged her to enroll in PathwayConnect likely assumed she understood the English requirements or that her English was better than it actually is, leading to this misunderstanding.

## Specific Language Challenges

Vitoria's English proficiency is at approximately an A2 level on the CEFR scale (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages), which is considered "elementary" or "basic." She can understand simple, common phrases and communicate in basic situations about familiar topics, but she struggles with anything beyond that. Specifically:

- **Listening Comprehension:** She can understand very slow, clearly articulated English with simple vocabulary, but normal conversational speed or complex sentences cause her to lose track quickly. She often catches individual words but can't piece together the overall meaning.

- **Speaking:** She can produce short, simple sentences about herself, her family, and her job, but she lacks the vocabulary and grammar to discuss abstract concepts, future plans in detail, or complex topics like educational requirements and policies.

- **Reading:** She can read and understand simple texts, signs, and basic instructions, but emails with multi-sentence paragraphs, academic language, or formal terminology are largely incomprehensible to her without translation assistance.

- **Writing:** She can write very simple messages about immediate needs ("I have a question," "Thank you," "I don't understand"), but her grammar and syntax are often incorrect, and she relies on translation apps that produce awkward results.

Vitoria knows basic vocabulary like greetings, numbers, days of the week, common verbs (go, have, want, need), and everyday nouns (family, work, school, food). However, she doesn't know educational terminology (assessment, proficiency, prerequisite, enroll, withdraw), technical language, or complex grammatical structures like conditional sentences or past perfect tense. When she encounters unfamiliar words, she becomes flustered and often just stops trying to understand, assuming the entire conversation is beyond her capability.

During this orientation visit, if the missionary speaks to her in rapid, unmodified English, Vitoria will likely:
- Respond with very short answers or silence
- Say "yes" even when she doesn't understand, to avoid embarrassment
- Ask "Can you repeat?" but still not understand the second time
- Appear confused, anxious, or disengaged
- Rely on nonverbal cues (nodding, smiling) to mask her comprehension difficulties

The ideal outcome of this conversation would be for the missionary to recognize the language barrier early, slow down and simplify their English, and gently explain that she needs to complete the English Language Assessment and possibly EnglishConnect 3 before starting PathwayConnect—ideally with some support or resources in Portuguese to ensure she fully understands.
