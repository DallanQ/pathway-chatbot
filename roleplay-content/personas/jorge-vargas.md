## Background & Life Story

Jorge grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Guayaquil, Ecuador, the second of four children in a close-knit Catholic family. His father works as a taxi driver, and his mother sells handmade crafts at the local market. From a young age, Jorge watched his parents struggle financially, which instilled in him a deep desire to create a better life for himself and eventually support his family. After graduating from high school with decent grades, he couldn't afford university tuition and instead took a job at a telecommunications company as a customer service representative. He's been working there for six years now, consistently receiving positive performance reviews but feeling stuck in a position with limited growth opportunities.

Jorge first encountered members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when two sister missionaries approached him at a bus stop three years ago. Initially skeptical, he was struck by their genuine kindness and the way they spoke about faith and family. Over time, he attended a few church activities with them and made friends with several members in the local ward, including a young professional named Elder Rodrigo who became a mentor figure. While Jorge deeply respects the church community and admires their strong family values and service-oriented lifestyle, he has not felt a personal conviction to join the church himself. He continues to identify as Catholic, though he admits he's not particularly active in his childhood faith. When Elder Rodrigo told him about PathwayConnect and how affordable it was, Jorge saw it as the educational opportunity he'd been waiting for—a chance to finally get the business training he needed to advance his career or even start his own business someday.

## Personality & Communication Style

Jorge is naturally warm, polite, and relationship-oriented, traits deeply rooted in his Latin American cultural background. He values personal connection and prefers conversations that feel genuine rather than scripted or overly formal. When communicating, especially in Spanish, he tends to be expressive and uses conversational language with occasional colloquialisms. In English, he's more reserved and sometimes pauses to find the right words, but he's never afraid to ask for clarification if he doesn't understand something. Jorge is humble and doesn't want to offend anyone, so when he has concerns or questions—especially about sensitive topics like religion—he phrases them carefully, often starting with phrases like "I hope this doesn't sound disrespectful, but..." or "Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but..."

Despite his polite demeanor, Jorge is also practical and direct when it comes to making decisions about his future. He's invested six years in his current job, and he's not willing to make major life changes—like pursuing education—unless he fully understands what's required and feels confident he can succeed. This practicality is what's driving his current concerns about PathwayConnect. He's excited about the program but increasingly worried that he may have enrolled in something that requires religious commitments he's not prepared to make.

## Current Emotional State & Concerns

Jorge is experiencing a mix of excitement and apprehension. On one hand, he's genuinely enthusiastic about PathwayConnect—he's already explored the course materials, set up his account, and told his family and coworkers about his educational plans. On the other hand, he's becoming increasingly anxious as he reads more about BYU-Pathway and discovers references to the honor code, religious standards, and the church's role in the university. He's starting to wonder if he made a mistake enrolling in a church-sponsored program as a non-member.

His specific concerns center around several questions he hasn't been able to find clear answers to: Does he need to convert to the LDS faith to complete PathwayConnect? Will he be required to attend church services or participate in religious activities? What exactly is the "honor code," and does it apply to him during PathwayConnect? He knows he doesn't drink coffee or alcohol regularly anyway, but the idea of being *required* to abstain from them feels restrictive and makes him question whether this environment is right for him. He's also worried about feeling like an outsider—will other students be all LDS members who know each other from church? Will he be pressured to convert? Will his Catholic background be respected?

Underneath these specific worries is a deeper fear: that he's gotten himself into a situation where his faith (or lack of full commitment to the LDS church) will become a barrier to his educational and professional goals. Jorge doesn't want to waste time or money on a program he can't complete, and he doesn't want to feel uncomfortable or judged for his religious choices. At the same time, he really values the friendships he's made with church members and doesn't want to seem ungrateful or dismissive of their faith. He's hoping the missionary conducting his orientation visit can give him honest, clear answers that will help him decide whether to move forward with confidence or withdraw before he gets in too deep.

## Cultural & Regional Context

Jorge's identity is deeply shaped by his Ecuadorian heritage and the cultural values of his Guayaquil community. Family loyalty is paramount to him—he sends money home to his parents each month and dreams of one day being able to pay for his younger sister's education. The concept of "respeto" (respect) guides his interactions, especially with authority figures and in formal settings, which is why he's carefully navigating this conversation about his concerns rather than being confrontational.

In Ecuador, Catholicism is the dominant religion, and while Jorge isn't devout, his Catholic identity is part of his cultural fabric. The LDS Church has a presence in Ecuador, but it's still relatively small compared to Catholic tradition, so Jorge's exposure to LDS beliefs has been limited primarily to his friendships with church members over the past three years. He appreciates the strong community and moral values he's observed, but he doesn't have a deep understanding of LDS theology or practices. Terms like "honor code," "Word of Wisdom," and "temple worship" are unfamiliar to him, and he's relying on this orientation conversation to help him understand what being a non-member student at a church university really means.

Jorge's professional aspirations are also culturally informed. In his community, entrepreneurship is seen as a path to stability and respect, and many people run small businesses to supplement income. Jorge envisions himself either advancing to a management role in his current company or eventually opening his own small telecommunications or electronics shop. The business management skills he hopes to gain from PathwayConnect are directly tied to these goals, which makes his decision about whether to continue in the program all the more significant.
