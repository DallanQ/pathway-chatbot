Example: If you are retaking PCB/PCIB 103, the only course you could retake in the same term would be the corresponding certificate course (not PCB/PCIB 101 or PCB/PCIB 102). Returning Students: A returning student is any student who has completed at least one course with a passing grade. If you have the a course previously, have taken a break, and are now trying to return you will be given the option to retake previous courses when using the PCB/PCIB 102 application. Enrollment Options: | Term | | | --- | --- | | Block 1 | Block 2 | | Option 1: PCB/PCIB 101 | PCB/PCIB 102 | | Option 2: PCB/PCIB 103 + Certificate Course | | See **BYU Pathway Academic Calendar** for enrollment dates and deadlines for the different blocks. The above courses are the only courses available during those block times. **Already Received a Passing Grade**: You will not be required to retake any courses within a term in which you have already received a passing grade. For example, if you did not receive a passing grade on your introductory certificate course, but you did pass PCB/PCIB 103, you will not be required to also retake PCB/PCIB 103 while retaking your certificate course. You will need to receive an enrollment exception and will need to fill out the following **general petition link**. **Retaking Courses Out of Sequence**: Normally you take the next course in sequence (for example PCB/PCIB 102 to PCB/PCIB 103). However, you may opt to retake a previous course out of sequence (for example PCB/PCIB 102 to retaking PCB/PCIB 101). Previous Balance: If you have a previous balance or bad debt you are not permitted to retake a course until you have paid that balance. You will be charged tuition for retaking courses. **Retaking as a Block Class**: If you took a class as a 14-week course you will need to retake the course as a block class. 14-week courses are no longer offered. | **2.

This does not mean they need to complete the degree after their certificate. If the student has already graduated with a degree and would like to pursue another certificate, they will need to declare another degree in order to declare the certificate. However, they do not need to earn a second degree; it just makes it possible for them to be enrolled. As a student, they may declare up to 3 certificates at a time. However, it is encouraged to pursue only 1 at a time. Certificates that are declared on their account must be in the same catalog year. If a student wants to choose a certificate that is not related to the major they have declared, they will need to change their major to Professional Studies and then choose the eligible certificate. To find eligible certificates, do the following: 1. Go to: Certificates and Degrees Program List 2. Scroll until you see “View Available Online Certificates” 3. Under the bachelor's degree section, Select Professional Studies 4.

      "text: Applicant Ecclesiastical Endorsement | (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University- Idaho Information | | --- | | Non-members are welcome to participate in the Online Degrees program. They must receive an application endorsement, as well as annual endorsements. Those Endorsements are obtained through their own Ecclesiastical Leader or a local LDS leader, as well as the University Chaplain. The Chaplain will contact the student for their Endorsement interview. If the student has questions about how long it will take, advise them that it will be taken care of as soon as possible. BYUI has asked specifically that we not put a time frame on how long it takes the chaplain to reach out. It is a wide range based on demand. If a student is concerned, we can check with BYU-Idaho on a case-by-case basis. **Advise the student that the Chaplain may have already attempted to contact them via phone or email. Please ask them to check their SPAM or Junk email folders to ensure that they have not missed this communication.** If the student is a non-member, they will need to choose one of the following options for acquiring an ecclesiastical endorsement: * During the “Start Endorsement” section, review endorsement instructions. + Indicate if you want to interview with your own religious leader or if you will interview with a bishop/branch president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. + Indicate that you have read and understood. * Click “Begin My Endorsement”. * Interview with own religious leader + If you selected that you want to meet with your own religious leader, a window will pop-up with instructions for completing the endorsement. You will need to meet with your own leader. After submitting your endorsement with your leader, you will be contacted by a University Chaplain. + Print the leader instructions and schedule an interview with your leader. + Your leader should submit the endorsement. + The “Start Endorsement” page of the application will now indicate that the endorsement process has been started. + You can re-review the non-member instructions by clicking “View Instructions”. * Interview with bishop or branch president + If you selected that you want to interview with a bishop or branch president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, select “Find a Church Unit”. + A window will pop-up so that you can search for the bishop you will interview with. You can search by Unit Name, and Leader First Name, Leader Last Name. + Select the leader you will interview with. + Confirm your selection. + The “Start Endorsement” section of the application will indicate that the endorsement process has started. + Contact the bishop and schedule an appointment. Applicants who are currently on informal or formal probation with, disfellowshipped or excommunicated from, or voluntarily disaffiliated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are not admissible to BYU-Idaho. The First Presidency has asked Ecclesiastical leaders to not endorse applicants for admission if they have any unresolved worthiness issues at the time of the application deadline.

Schools such as BYU-Idaho and Ensign College cannot see into the endorsement application. - Interview questions have been updated to focus on a student's effort to grow spiritually. Students who are of another faith are asked different questions than those who are members. In general, the questions for nonmembers ask if the student will obey the Word of Wisdom, law of chastity, be honest, and support Church teachings. - Additional details on these updates can be found in the Church newsroom.\n",
