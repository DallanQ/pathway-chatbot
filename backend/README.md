This is a [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) project using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) bootstrapped with [`create-llama`](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/packages/create-llama).

## Getting Started

First, setup the environment with poetry: https://python-poetry.org/

> **_Note:_** This step is not needed if you are using the dev-container.

```
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Then check the parameters that have been pre-configured in the `.env` file in this directory. (E.g. you might need to configure an `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you're using OpenAI as model provider).

Second, run the development server:

```
python main.py
```

The example provides two different API endpoints:

1. `/api/chat` - a streaming chat endpoint
2. `/api/chat/request` - a non-streaming chat endpoint

You can test the streaming endpoint with the following curl request:

```
curl --location 'localhost:8000/api/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }] }'
```

And for the non-streaming endpoint run:

```
curl --location 'localhost:8000/api/chat/request' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }] }'
```

You can start editing the API endpoints by modifying `app/api/routers/chat.py`. The endpoints auto-update as you save the file. You can delete the endpoint you're not using.

Open [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) with your browser to see the Swagger UI of the API.

The API allows CORS for all origins to simplify development. You can change this behavior by setting the `ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to `prod`:

```
ENVIRONMENT=prod python main.py
```
