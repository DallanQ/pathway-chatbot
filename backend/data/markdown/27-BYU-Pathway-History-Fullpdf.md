## Working The Soil – Foundations Of Church Education

### The Priority Of Learning

Since the beginning of the restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Church educational philosophy has included the injunction to "teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom" (D&C 88:77)

Church founder and prophet, Joseph Smith employed these philosophies by establishing schools in towns scattered across the Midwest. Even at the genesis of the LDS Church, education has played a pivotal role in the LDS community. Whenever Latter-day Saint communities were organized, among the first

# Institutions to be provided were places of learning

Knowledge and education have within them the power to change the world. Education can give new life and untold confidence. For over one hundred years the Church has ventured to help educate its membership both religiously and secularly. Yet meeting educational needs has become increasingly complex in what has become a global Church.

## Finding the Right Vehicle for Church Education

Finding the right vehicle in which to expand Church education internationally proved a difficult task. The Church lacked concentration of students in similar areas in order to make the seminary and institute program function beneficially. A home-study program was introduced and eventually expanded to England, Australia, and New Zealand. One of the conflicts this program discovered in the form of a "public relations challenge" was that in order to rally sufficient support of the program, program coordinators would need to spend far too much time converting the local leaders to the ideas of seminary. This lesson would be learned once again forty years later. Waiting for interest to be expressed from local Church leaders, as well as placing program ownership and oversight under priesthood keys was something that proved difficult for them.

## Church Education Policy Evolution

In conjunction with the burgeoning global expansion of religious education, a new policy was introduced in 1971 governing Church primary and secondary schools. This Commissioner's Report titled "Seek Learning Even by Study and Faith," established a three-fold focus for Church education:
1. Literacy and basic education are gospel needs
2. Church programs will not duplicate otherwise available opportunities especially in higher education
3. Ultimately all high school and college-age Latter-day Saints should have access to weekday religious education, in tandem with secular education.

## Henry B. Eyring's Contribution to Global Church Education

Henry B. Eyring, serving as Church Commissioner of Education from 1980 to 1985, worked with Church leadership for global expansion of Church education. He recorded in his journal a valuable lesson he learned from Elder Boyd K. Packer regarding international Church growth. He learned that "treating every member of the Church equally means meeting his needs in a way appropriate to his or her needs and country, not imposing the same chapel designs, the same organization structures, or the same programs on everyone everywhere. Giving a member in Peru what is preferred on the Wasatch Front can be giving him less than giving him a simpler building and program suited to him. And it can cost a lot more." This lesson would serve him much in the coming years as he would continue to become a leading figure in the expansion of Church education into the twenty-first century.

Though many attempts were made in the twentieth century to globally expand Church education making it available to all members, only the direct extension of religious education was successful. Initiatives to take secular education to all Church members were rooted in the doctrine of learning, however they lacked the necessary instruments, funding and articulate vision to breed success. The seeds that would eventually germinate to more effectively achieve that objective had been planted, however, more than one hundred years ago in the cultivated soil of Rexburg, Idaho.

# Planting The Seed – Ricks College And Byu-Idaho

## From Henry B. Eyring To David A. Bednar

In July 1971, Henry B. Eyring was named as the tenth president of Ricks College. Reflecting on his arrival at Ricks, Eyring recalled that "I was in a place unlike anything I had ever seen before, and if I had an impression come over me, it was 'forget everything you think you know, just don't change this place much.'" Eyring discovered that the "Spirit of Ricks" included a group of

# Teachers Who Cared About Individual Students

Teachers who cared about individual students in a way he never thought possible.

## Inaugural Response of Eyring

In his inaugural response, Eyring espoused the idea of Ricks College reaching far beyond the campus in Rexburg. He stated, "We must also find ways for this college to serve young people whose needs are shaped by a great variety of cultures and situations, and who may not be able to come to this campus. We will find direct ways to move the blessing of education...from this campus out into the lives of men and women everywhere."

## Leadership of Eyring

Under Eyring's leadership, the college continued to increase its physical presence with roots firmly planted in Rexburg. Staying close to its pioneer roots was something Eyring felt was necessary in order for the school to fulfill its divine purpose. He reflected on the impressions he had as president of Ricks by saying, "they were only subtle impressions—feelings that this was a special place that needed to keep its spiritual standards high while staying close to its roots. I particularly felt the need to maintain our pioneer frugality."

The two-year junior college continued to grow, and enrollment increased by 20% to six thousand students during Eyring's presidency. By its centennial year in 1988, 7,694 students were enrolled representing 49 states, 36 foreign nations, and 12 religious affiliations. This enrollment mark exceeded the 7,500 cap, causing administrators to seek ways to decrease enrollment in 1989. Enrollment continued to exceed the cap until 1997 when the enrollment ceiling was removed.

Focused on admitting as many students as possible, a fast-track program was developed in 1997 encouraging students to take advanced placement courses during high school so that an associate's degree could be obtained after only one year on campus. Admission limits now depended only according to campus space that would allow for about 8,250 students in 1997 and possibly reach 9,000. At a commencement address in 1997, Henry B. Eyring, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, reflected that Ricks College "has grown in its power to accelerate learning beyond anything I foresaw…. There is a greater faith among those who come here that there are, with the help of God, no limits to our growth."

On July 1, 1997, David A. Bednar became the fourteenth president of Ricks College. Bednar's background in management and decision-making would become more vital to the evolution of the College than he or anyone could have guessed. He quickly began requesting recommendations from the faculty to rewrite the school's key goals and mission, with particular consideration to serve more students at an affordable cost. During his presidency, the school continued the spirit of innovation and also continued to experience great change.

# Becoming BYU-Idaho

Beginning his service at what had become the largest private two-year college in the U.S., Bednar was visited that September by President James E. Faust and Elder Henry B. Eyring members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve, respectively. They were to dedicate the new John Taylor Building. Having just returned from a trip to South America, Eyring—serving his second stint as Commissioner of Church Education—accompanied Bednar on a brief walk-through of the Taylor Building. Standing beneath the vaulted ceilings of the Taylor Chapel, Elder Eyring surveyed the seating area for several minutes. Curious to know his thoughts, President Bednar inquired, "Elder Eyring, what are you thinking about?" Eyring's response was both "profound and penetrating": "I am thinking about how much we do for so few and how little we do for so many. The tithing of the people I just visited in South America and from good people all over the world paid for this facility. And most of the people who have made this beautiful facility possible will never see or step foot in a building like this." These words left an indelible impression on Bednar that influenced his entire presidency. Bednar challenged the faculty to change their paradigm and

# Considerations for Global Impact

Consider how the school might serve 50,000 students globally and impact the entire global Church membership.

By 2004, over 130 Ricks College associate degree programs would convert to BYU-Idaho's 18 associate programs and 49 bachelor's degree programs. Campus faculty increased by 100, and about a dozen buildings were constructed or renovated. By the end of Bednar's presidency during fall Semester 2004—when he was called to join the Quorum of the Twelve—enrollment had increased from 8,840 FTE during winter 2000 to 10,767 FTE. With the new three-track system, the number of students being served had increased from 14,874 in 2000 to over 17,000 students in 2004.

Bednar's presidency oversaw a "pivotal time in an essential work." With "immediate national and international recognition" the small frontier academy would now become a "first-class" university. A school that had repetitively "teetered on the edge of oblivion only to be pulled back time and again by the sacrifice and determination of those who loved her so well," now with roots planted firmly, would grow in strength and become increasingly recognized throughout the world, and it would never fail. The brief announcement introducing BYU-Idaho redefined the school and from that moment this remote, rural campus would begin a process of becoming "world famous."

## Continual Growth – "Rethinking Education"

### Kim B. Clark's Vision

"What we're doing here is a new model for education." This statement came from Kim B. Clark soon after his inauguration as successor to David A. Bednar. Kim Clark had been serving for the last ten years as the Dean of the Harvard Business School. He left that prestigious position after an unexpected invitation from President Gordon B. Hinckley to become president of BYU-Idaho. In an interview with Charlie Rose on his last day at Harvard, Clark stated with some vigor, "We are going to reinvent undergraduate education out there. We're going to have a great time." He continued, "I get a chance to really think about creating the future because I am going into an environment where we are going to take on undergraduate education and do some new things." Clark's "laser focus" was on preparing young people through undergraduate education. This focus would be realized through "innovation and change and growth, and doing it at a breathtaking pace.

### BYU-Idaho Learning Model

Germinating in President Clark's mind prior to arriving at BYU-Idaho was the feeling of a need to take education to Church members in all areas of the world. Making some improvements and changes on campus would be vital to positioning the University to fulfill that mission. In hopes to create disciple-leaders and unite the power of study and faith, Clark stated that "inspired learning and teaching is the symbolic keystone to the overall campus experience. It brings discipleship preparation and leadership development together in one great whole."

In 2007, the BYU-Idaho Learning Model was approved and implemented throughout the University as one of the most important things Clark's presidency did on campus to prepare the University for the future. The BYU-Idaho Learning Model eventually became a key component in expanding global Church education. Clark's desire was to create a common framework for learning and teaching across campus that both students and faculty could understand and apply. This model would consist of

Benjamin Charles Peterson — Master's Thesis

Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

# Principles And A Process Rather Than Methods That Governed Effective Teaching And Learning

The five guiding principles of the Learning Model are:

1. Exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as a principle of power;
2. Understand that true teaching is done by and with the Spirit of the Holy Ghost;
3. Lay hold upon the word of God as found in the holy scriptures and in the words of the prophets in all disciplines;
4. Act for themselves and accept responsibility for learning and teaching;
5. Love, serve, and teach one another.

The Learning Model is an active learning pedagogy that focuses on improving a student's learning experience by engaging them in the teaching process. It endorses the notion that teachers become facilitators of learning rather than dispensers of information. The three elements of the Learning Model process are: Prepare, Teach One Another, and Ponder/Prove. It encourages student preparation before attending class to deepen classroom discussion, promote subsequent reflection, and deepen understanding of the material covered in class as the student prepares for the following class session. Active learning is essential to the desired outcome of learning by faith and increasing the quality of education. Coupled with the Learning Model in the quest to deepen the learning experience are the Foundations courses.

## The Vision Of Online Learning

During his time at Harvard, Clark had some involvement using technology in education. After being invited by Gordon B. Hinckley to become president of BYU-Idaho, he began researching previous University addresses given by Bednar and Henry B. Eyring. Clark sensed from their messages that BYU-Idaho existed to serve more than those who came to the campus in Southeastern Idaho. As he prepared his inaugural response, he saw an image of children across the world who would make and keep covenants with the Lord, and he knew that the Lord desires to bless them with education. He felt that it was BYU-Idaho's responsibility to take education to them. In his inaugural response, Clark said:

> We will find new ways to use information technology to reach more students and to deepen the learning experience of those we touch. In a day not far from now, we will be able to break down the barriers of time and space and connect our students on internships or between semesters to the university and to each other and, in that way, create outstanding, interactive educational experiences for them. In these experiences, students will teach one another in new and powerful ways. I believe that at BYU-Idaho we must learn to use new technologies and develop methods, materials, programs, and concepts that not only can be applied to our students on and off our campus but also can be effectively and efficiently applied by others across the Church and, indeed, across the world. I am convinced that this university is in this valley where our pioneer heritage is deeply ingrained, here the people are humble and faithful, so that we can be a proving ground of great fidelity for education that will bless the young people of the Church worldwide.

In 2005, Henry J. Eyring arrived at BYU-Idaho as Associate Academic Vice-President with responsibility for online learning and instructional technology. Eyring explained that for him, the online learning initiative began on a hilltop in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. Visiting the country in 1998 in search of prospective MBA students for BYU's Marriott School of Management, Eyring discovered that one of the problems he faced was finding applicants who were able to qualify for MBA study and leave their homeland. He found himself on the top of a hill that stood above one of the world's largest slums. A close observation of the temporary shanties below revealed satellite dishes on the rooftops of a.

The Younger Eyring Envisioned The Possibility Of Using Technology To Offer Quality Education To Even The Impoverished. He Would Later Fill A Significant Role In Realizing This Vision.

## Bachelor Of University Studies Degree And Online Learning

After Kim Clark and Henry J. Eyring arrived at BYU-Idaho in 2005, Clark said it was remarkably clear that a big part of the future of the University would be taking quality education to the world. Their initial strategy was to continue to develop some online courses internally, but to supplement those with courses they would purchase from BYU in Provo. They engaged in protracted negotiations with BYU to purchase some 90 courses, however BYU had allowed faculty members to maintain ownership in their courses and was not able to sell them. As negotiations ended, Clark and his online team, including Alan Young, had decided on a cohort, semester-based concept and began losing interest in an independent study model.

Through their Continuing Education department, BYU-Idaho began pursuing a semester-based online bachelor's degree program in July 2005, while simultaneously working to improve existing online courses and propose designs for new courses. BYU-Idaho eventually began offering an online Bachelor of University Studies degree in September 2007 with the intent of allowing students who had formerly completed at least 30 credits on campus an opportunity to finish their degree online with no classroom component. The University did not have all the needed online courses available when they began offering the Bachelor of University Studies degree so they partnered with BYU Independent Study to fill in the courses that were lacking. Each BYU-Idaho online course would enroll students from three groups: online degree-seeking students, on-campus students desiring an online course, and off-track students whose assigned educational track did not convene during the current semester.

When Clark's team had looked at purchasing online courses from BYU, they began looking through the course designs and realized that in order to accomplish their vision, they would need to completely redo the courses. Clark contends that it was not an issue of "Not Invented Here" syndrome, but rather that it would take as much work to rewrite the courses to fit their objectives, as it would to simply create new courses themselves. As they began developing courses, they saw their own on-campus courses as their biggest opportunity.

In the design of their online courses, BYU-Idaho had nearly broken precedent in their effort to first build course quality. A lead developer in course design in Rexburg asserted that "the quality of the learning experience is the top priority for any online course created at BYU-Idaho." The University sought to enrich the experience and expand educational opportunities rather than sacrifice quality for quantity.

Advancing toward global education, Clark charged Eyring in 2007 to form a team known as Enrollment Enhancement II. His hope was to expand even more online education beyond the Rexburg campus, even reaching young people who were often seen as unfit for college. It was believed that some form of online education could enable the University to serve more students while simultaneously increasing quality of education and reducing relative costs per student. Eyring appointed Clark Gilbert as a lead in the online initiative.

Gilbert, who was about to receive tenure at the Harvard Business School, came to BYU-Idaho in 2006 on a prompting that required a step in the dark. At Harvard,

# Gilbert's Expertise in Disruptive Innovation

Gilbert was considered an expert at applying Clayton Christensen's theory of disruptive innovation. Included in his theory was the idea that in order to successfully innovate, an organization must create a separate entity that will lead innovative efforts. This would prevent the existing entity from feeling threatened by internal innovative competition, and also preclude the existing entity from dismissing innovation as disruptive or impractical. Ultimately, the two decided that the online organization would remain within the University, but that it would be separate from traditional departments—separate, but integrated.

## Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

Clark's thought was to create a boundary that said there is such a thing as an online organization that is great at serving students online and takes us into a whole new world, but also have that organization to be an integral part of the University"—keeping department chairs, syllabi, and processes connected. The idea was to have one admissions office and one advising organization. Critical to this vision was the desire to assure accreditors that the online division was part of the University under the guidance of the academic vice-president, and also to preserve a common student experience.

Clark's instruction was to be ready for inspiration. "We know what it's going to look like for the next couple of years… But we have to be ready to be inspired by the Lord because he's in charge, and we can't see everything he sees."

Eyring and Gilbert also involved two professors—Janine Gilbert, and Paul Johanson—who helped design the original BYU-Idaho online courses—one in English and the other in math. Desiring to pilot the course in a remote location, they partnered with BYU-Hawaii—where Steven Wheelwright was then serving as president—to gather online students in Rexburg and Laie for a weekly face-to-face classroom experience. The gathering in each location was overseen by a student who had already taken the course. This peer mentor facilitated the classroom discussion using principles and steps from the Learning Model. One of the courses that was taught in partnership with BYU-Hawaii was an English course where students would gather remotely once or twice a week to work on assigned activities—all student-teacher communication was done online. These pilot classes taught the team that distance learning courses needed to be a hybrid of online and classroom instruction.

## Increasing Course Quality

The focus of the University's online efforts was not to displace traditional higher education, but instead to "improve and preserve" the traditional campus experience while disseminating it to individuals who would never be able to come to Rexburg. Thus, the decision was made to not allow online course development to become a separate activity from the rest of the University. Increasing course quality would include maximizing receipt of both knowledge and understanding. Experience had shown that knowledge could be more efficiently transmitted via an online course, however understanding was increasingly obtained and quality experience had more often existed in a classroom model. With a focus on quality first, it was decided that BYU-Idaho online courses were cohort-based with high levels of student collaboration—rather than following an independent study model. Online course offerings began and ended aligning with on-campus semester calendars.

Gilbert and his team recognized the value of the Learning Model and sought to design the online courses following the principles outlined in the Model in order to maximize student engagement and overall student learning experience. This style of online course required a unique teaching style. "It is a style of fostering student relationships, guiding student conversations, assessing student progress in critical thinking and analysis, and fostering participation and involvement, all through a largely text-based communication medium."

# Involving Full-Time Faculty with Course Creation

Involving full-time faculty with course creation, and requiring department approval of the course descriptions and outcomes tied the University's online entity back to the campus and facilitated a coherent aim at accomplishing the University's mission to create disciple-leaders. Furthering the effort to create one university was the request that on-campus courses maintain the same outcomes and assessments as their online equivalents.

Experience had taught Gilbert and his team that "when online courses are well-designed, both student satisfaction and measured learning can perform at levels comparable to even the most successful campus courses."

- Course readings served as a foundation for learning activities that formed the core design of each course.
- Graphics, video, and animations were used moderately and pointedly to enhance the learner's experience and the likelihood that knowledge and understanding would take root within the students' heart and mind.

Once designed, the online courses were taught by a full-time faculty member—usually one of the course developers—and were tested for efficacy in achieving the course objectives. Improvements were then made, and future course offerings were taught by full-time faculty members or adjunct instructors. With the cohort-based model, where student-to-student and student-to-teacher interaction are a priority, online courses would have required an enrollment cap. With this understanding, BYU-Idaho launched the online initiative in 2008 using online forums, discussion boards, podcasts, and wikis.

## Extending The BYU-Idaho Experience

By fall Semester of 2009, faculty-driven course development teams had created more than 30 new online courses, and remote adjunct instructors had been hired to teach them.

As the initial online courses were made available, only on-campus students were allowed to enroll. Instruction of these first-generation classes was provided by one of the on-campus faculty members involved in the course design.

BYU-Idaho Online secured quality instructors who seemed to share the same spirit of consecration referred to by Clark. As the courses were rolled out, the quality of student learning experiences was "very good," and each course underwent routine analysis and revision. Course quality continued to increase, and the model appeared to be more cost-effective than the campus-based model. As faculty immersed themselves in online course creation, most found that articulating the courses for online delivery impelled them to reconsider and enrich the quality of their course in the classroom. In Clark's original vision of these courses, he stated:

> Campus programs would themselves, over time, be transformed by what we learn in the online world and vice versa. There would be a flow and understanding that would help us be the very best we could be—that we learn how to take advantage of and exploit in a good sense the fact that there would be many students in many different countries and many different kinds of learning experiences and we would exploit that and learn from it and get better at the core mission of learning and teaching and we would become the very finest institution of learning and teaching in the world.

## A Proving Ground Of Fidelity

# Inaugural Address at BYU-Idaho by President Kim B. Clark

In his inaugural address at BYU-Idaho, President Kim B. Clark declared, "I am convinced that this university is in this valley where our pioneer heritage is deeply ingrained, where the people are humble and faithful, so that we can be a proving ground of great fidelity for education that will bless the young people of the Church worldwide." He further explained that a test of good fidelity is one that yields results on a small scale that accurately reflect—and thus predict—performance on a much larger scale. Vice-President Henry J. Eyring also observed that:

> "As we build an ever-better university, we can be a proving ground for education of great fidelity relative to the needs of all Church members, including the poorest. Somehow, our deeply ingrained pioneer heritage, manifest in humility and faith, will allow us to discover means of learning here that will work everywhere. The cost of this education will be low enough and the quality high enough. And we will prove it here first. The path to Rio, as it were, somehow runs through Rexburg."

By 2008, BYU-Idaho had capitalized on technology to enhance the on-campus learning experience, designed and made available dozens of innovative online courses, as well as an online Baccalaureate degree program. The University was changing through processes of disruptive innovation to "reinvent undergraduate education." BYU-Idaho faculty could dream of the day when the University's online learning capabilities would merge with peer instruction, the work of the Perpetual Education Fund and Church Institutes of Religion internationally, though at the time the path from Rexburg to the rest of the world was only visible as far as Rigby.

## Technology And Institute Buildings

While serving as President of BYU-Idaho in 1972, President Henry B. Eyring led a committee for the Church Educational System to examine the long-term future of higher education in the Church. Fundamental to the committee's purpose was the question, "How can we extend the reach and increase the impact of the Church Educational System's post-secondary education?" Committee discussions included the potential role of Institutes of Religion and technology to further the reach of Church education. Institute buildings would provide an enormous capital resource—approximately 1,000 buildings around the world—that could allow such a program to expand worldwide.

They had envisioned faith-based learning that would take place in CES campuses, Institute campuses, chapels, and homes. The committee's work was visionary, though decades ahead of its time. Henry B. Eyring recalls that "it was more a feeling of what ought to be than what would be."

Fifteen years later, and a few months prior to launching the BYU-Idaho online initiative, Clark decided in April 2008 that with a model in place, it was an appropriate time to forge a program that would allow the University to reach individuals across the globe. Clark ran projections of the LDS population of 18-year-olds in North America. There was a projected decline that would bottom-out in 2011 followed by a substantial spike beginning in 2014.

Regardless of the then decline in college-aged LDS students, BYU-Idaho's enrollment was on the rise. The fear was that if enrollment was increasing with a regressive populace, what would happen in 2014 when the trend reverses and thousands and thousands of 18-year-olds are graduating from high school every year? In hopes to address educational needs that were not being met, Clark's intent was

# Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

## Clark Gilbert's Vision

Clark Gilbert had a vision that if individuals could not attend in Rexburg, the university would go to them. His vision, however, was not that of any old online program.

Clark approached Gilbert and proposed the initiative to take education far beyond the borders of the campus. He insisted that a proposal be drafted to take to the Executive Committee two weeks later.

## Collaboration with J.D. Griffith

Clark Gilbert sought the help of J.D. Griffith, who had been working for Ron Campbell in Continuing Education. Griffith recorded in his journal, "My next new assignment is trying to determine if we can work with institute buildings and teachers in certain parts of the country and teach BYU-Idaho classes at those buildings—a mix of hybrid and internet classes—in order to reach more students."

Using a model that involved both technology and institute buildings to expand education was an idea that had germinated in Clark's mind before arriving in Rexburg. The idea also became apparent in his inaugural response when he stated that the University's efforts to reach more students "may come through educational activities and programs initiated by the Church-in wards and branches, in stakes, and in seminaries and institutes."

## Henry J. Eyring's Perspective

Henry J. Eyring stated, "If we can help them learn by the Spirit and make important decisions without the benefit of having been on our campus, we'll have discovered more of the pedagogy required to someday lift those who will never come here."

## Pursuing the Vision

Determined to pursue this vision of online education involving institute buildings, Clark spoke with Henry B. Eyring, who was a member of BYU-Idaho's Board of Trustees and the Church's First Presidency. Eyring agreed that questions should be asked and that there may be more that the Church can do in utilizing these resources to carry education to the people. Clark then approached Griffith and expressed the poignant feeling he had that "there is something with institute buildings and online education," and commissioned him to find out what it was. Griffith's background in marketing led him to seek out possible opportunities.

Within two weeks, all of the pieces came together to form the initial seeds of what would become the Pathway program. Griffith and Gilbert rigorously worked on a proposal that was presented by Kim B. Clark to the CES Executive Committee on December 17, 2008.

## The Proposal: "Expanded Educational Opportunities"

The proposal suggested a two-pronged approach to providing opportunities for the 36,800 LDS North American 18-year-olds who did not plan to attend college and the 15,200 who would receive minimal vocational training. It was proposed that online courses would be offered through BYU-Idaho, "coupled with religious education and gathering opportunities available at local institutes." Clark considered the gathering element critical to providing "assurance, encouragement, social interaction, and a sense of purpose for students who traditionally would not seek a higher education experience."

The proposal also aimed to tap into the spiritual benefits of the program, suggesting that providing expanded academic options would increase the motivation for these students to gather—thus creating an additional avenue for spiritually strengthening these young people.

## Further Details of the Proposal

The pilot, to be done in partnership with Seminaries and Institutes of Religion, will target groups of students in three or four locations that have a large LDS population, a strong BYU-Idaho alumni base, a healthy Institute program, and established BYU-Idaho distant site learning programs. Interested students would enroll in:

1. Online courses offered through BYU-Idaho, the same courses offered on campus, with the same academic processes, timelines, and standards.
2. Approved religious education courses offered through the

### Degree By Being Admitted To The University, Attending Institute, And Completing Graduation Requirements.

With hopes to enroll pilot students that fall semester, on January 29, J.D. Griffith, Ron Campbell, and Clark Gilbert met in Salt Lake City with Chad Webb—Administrator of Seminaries and Institutes of Religion. They looked to the Seminaries and Institute program as a partner for the spiritual growth of the students and asked for their help to allow use of institute buildings for the students to gather each week.

Webb expressed a desire for BYU-Idaho to bring sufficient people to accomplish the required work to support their program. Assured that BYU-Idaho would provide the manpower, Webb gave them his support in proposing a program that would utilize the framework of existing institute buildings. In retrospect, Griffith's journal entry that night looked to the future: "We have started the first phase of our BYU-I/institute distant site program. The potential for this new program is very big. President Clark described it similar to being on the frontier. We are laying the groundwork for distance education that may change education forever.

## Focus Groups

Pilot sites for distant learning would need a large LDS population, a healthy Institute program, limited impact on existing relationships between the local Institute and other educational institutions, and a full-time Institute director. It was also preferred that the sites be in close proximity to an LDS temple and singles wards. Nine sites were identified for consideration: Gresham, OR; New York, NY; Houston, TX; Las Vegas, NV; Fresno, CA; Denver, CO; Nampa, ID; Tacoma, WA; and Mesa AZ. The three locations with the highest number of enrolled institute students not attending college were selected.

Griffith phoned a friend who was an institute director in Nampa, Idaho and was soon also connected with an institute director in Mesa, Arizona. The third site in Manhattan, New York aligned with a previous suggestion from Clark that they also go east. These three sites were also deliberately selected with hopes to learn from their diverse characteristics. Nampa—a rural farming community, Mesa—a community that was a center of strength for the Church, and Manhattan—an urban, highly immigrant community. Griffith asked each of the three institute directors, "Do you have young adults coming to your institute that are not enrolled at the university?" All three responded with some vigor, "Oh yeah!" Determined to meet with those groups of individuals, Griffith and Gilbert visited each site to conduct focus group sessions in February and March of 2009.

A large number of students attending the first focus group in Nampa revealed a great demand for higher education. In Manhattan, once again the demand exceeded their expectations and hundreds of individuals filled the chapel and cultural hall for that focus group meeting. The demographics at the three focus groups ranged from those already possessing over 30 college credits, to those who had only dreamed of attending college. There was a mix of potential students who were employed full-time, part-time and jobless. Some had served LDS missions and some had not. There were those who had been life-time members of the Church and others who were recent converts. They also found that roughly 40% of the members in the Queens, New York Stake were undocumented residents in the U.S. The groups' collective attitude about college was positive. It was clear that these students understood the value of an education. When asked "Why are you not

# Enrolled in College?

The top three responses to this question were revealing. They included financial concern, issues regarding lack of self-confidence and hope, and lack of accessibility of higher education due to time or location.

## Surprising Demographics

Going in with the assumption they would be interviewing 18-year-olds, Gilbert and Griffith were astounded that in Manhattan, only about 60% of the room consisted of that younger age group and they "were thrilled that so many priesthood leaders would come and show their support." It soon surprised them to discover that the other 40% that did include many priesthood leaders were not there simply to support the younger populace, but rather they were there because of their own interest in obtaining a post-secondary education. Before leaving New York, Gilbert and Griffith learned that capable individuals over 30 years old, who had missed an earlier opportunity, had a great need to obtain higher education and training. These individuals had felt that education was beyond their reach and it became clear to Gilbert and Griffith how desperately they wanted a BYU-Idaho education. These potential students shared optimistic attitudes regarding the possibility of online courses, though they expressed concerns about quality, access to the course instructors, and the feeling of being on their own. It was apparent that these groups loved the idea of gathering and associating at the local institute buildings. One concern from these focus groups was that only 25% of them had access to a laptop.

## Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

Gilbert and Griffith began these focus groups with the question, "If our typical BYU-Idaho student can't come to Rexburg, how can we go to them?" They quickly realized, however, that there was a massive population that would never have come to BYU-Idaho or any other college. Gilbert sensed that there was a fear in the hearts of some that they would never be able to obtain the education they wanted, but that there was also a hope that the Church would bring them a chance that would work for them. Some of them did not perform well academically in high school, and some were not currently eligible for an ecclesiastical endorsement.

When asked what classes the group would be interested in taking, their response included basic Freshman courses, and as discussions continued it became apparent that these students needed some bridge courses to jump-start their academic journey. This shifted Gilbert and Griffith's focus. A realization came that this new initiative is not about reaching out to the world, but rather about reaching down and lifting up—serving the underserved. Their conclusion was that this new program would need to be affordable, build hope and confidence, prepare individuals for a college education, and also make education accessible to individuals over 30 years old.

After returning from the early focus groups, Griffith recalls meeting a lot of young adults who could not qualify for an ecclesiastical endorsement—an endorsement from a local Church leader declaring a student's worthiness and willingness to abide by the University's Honor Code. Such an endorsement is required of all students attending a CES institution of higher education. When discussing the issue with the University president, Clark suggested that perhaps an endorsement would not be necessary for students enrolled in the first year of Pathway. The issue was discussed at length and ultimately the decision was made that there would be no ecclesiastical endorsement required for the first year of the program. This would bless the lives of thousands of individuals and would open up the real possibility of using the program as a ministering tool to bring individuals back to full Church activity.

## Academic "Path"

With Board approval for a pilot of this new education initiative to launch in the Fall of 2009, and additional direction from recent focus groups, Griffith was now tasked with the responsibility to create the program. At the micro-level

# Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

## Overview

The exploratory effort led by Griffith, reporting to Clark Gilbert, focused on the macro level initiative known as "Enrollment Enhancement II," which involved a committee comprising Clark Gilbert, Henry J. Eyring, Ron Campbell, J.D. Griffith, and Betty Oldham. The committee recognized the need for bridge courses, leading to the development of courses forming an "Academic Path," later termed "Academic Start." Central to the program was religious education, aimed at facilitating learning skills acquisition and enhancing market value.

## Academic Start Program Development

- The final courses for Academic Start included:
- GS 120 Life Skills
- English 106 (a pre-101 course)
- Math 100G (developed in collaboration with LDS Business College)

- The concept of a cohort model was introduced by Clark Gilbert, where students would enroll and progress through Academic Start as a group for the first year.
- The program emphasized a balance between spiritual and secular education, with religious education forming the foundational component.
- Students would enroll in a 3 credit-hour Academic Start course alongside a 2 credit-hour institute course concurrently.

## Program Structure and Implementation

- The Academic Start program spanned one year and operated on a cohort-based system, offering students 15 credit hours.
- Initially considering an accelerated credit load option, the team opted to maintain the one-year program for all enrolled students.
- Students were expected to apply to BYU-Idaho during the second semester and attend institute classes throughout the Academic Start program.

## Focus on Student Success

- Griffith's focus group report emphasized the importance of early academic success to build student confidence.
- The program aimed to offer various degree and certificate pathways leading to a bachelor's degree.
- Tuition pricing discussions led to the decision to set the cost at $65 per credit hour, making the program more affordable than local alternatives.

## Simplifying Enrollment Processes

- Addressing concerns about the complexity of college applications, Griffith's team streamlined the process by developing a one-page application.
- The team aimed to eliminate barriers to college enrollment, considering the cumbersome nature of the existing CES application.

## Scalability and Global Reach

- To manage sites in different locations, the idea of utilizing service missionaries was proposed.
- Griffith envisioned a scalable program, likened to a franchise packet, that could be implemented worldwide.

## Weekly Gathering

On a visit to BYU-Idaho as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, David A. Bednar said:

> The spirit of gathering brings assurance, encouragement, and a sense of purpose greater than self. At BYU-Idaho you gather…together to learn and to prepare for your mortal and eternal opportunities and responsibilities. You gather together to strengthen each other. You gather together to develop appropriate relationships and to create eternal families. You gather together to increase in understanding about the purpose and measure of your creation."

Pathway's distant site and online learning program has held true to the principle of gathering. Each cohort of at least 10 students—and no more than 30—gathers together once each week, on Thursday evenings, to instruct and learn from each other. This gathering takes place in addition to online coursework. The online courses require approximately 6 to 8 hours of work each week and are administered by an online instructor. As a part of the online experience students engage in dialogue on various topics with other Pathway students throughout the world. The weekly gathering component is seen as a necessary supplement to the online course. At each weekly gathering the service missionary couples begin and end the meeting as well as make any necessary announcements, but all of the teaching and learning are done by Pathway students.

Rather than using a traditional lecture method that is part of most university courses, BYU-Idaho— including these Pathway gatherings—uses a teaching and learning model where lead students engage their classmates in discussions and learning activities. Lead students are given the role of helping other students accept and embrace responsibility for their own learning through specific "steps to success." Some of these steps include seeking the will of God and guidance of the Holy Ghost, beginning with the end in mind, making the lesson enjoyable and inspiring, and facilitating active and deep learning.

The first year, called Academic Start, required students to enroll in two classes each semester—an institute course and one of three Academic Start courses. All three Academic Start courses are tied to the gathering element and all discussions and activities that make up the gathering are directly connected to that week's lesson in the Academic Start course. The role of the lead students during the Life Skills course is greater than during the Math or English courses.

The spirit of gathering, combined with a learning model that places students in the teaching role, establishes astounding confidence in the hearts of Pathway students. The gathering element of the cohort model has allowed students to feel a sense of family among their peers. They stand up for each other and they fight to build and help each other succeed. It has also led to higher student satisfaction and retention.

Service missionaries facilitated the gathering and kindly reminded students when assignments were overdue and encouraged them to help each other. They saw

## Piloting Three Sites

During the spring and summer of 2009, as Pathway and Academic Start were being developed, J.D. Griffith approached former BYU-Idaho Honor Code counselor, April Spaulding, to discuss the possibility of developing a Pathway life skills course. This initiative was suggested by Clark Gilbert. They aimed to incorporate elements of the study and life skills from the Heber J. Grant course into the Academic Start program to enhance the abilities of Pathway students. Spaulding collaborated with Griffith to create a student-led curriculum for the Pathway Life Skills course (GS120), which adopted key elements of the Heber J. Grant course and tailored them to meet specific needs.

Spaulding later joined Pathway full-time to oversee GS120, manage all service missionaries, and assist in supervising the three pilot sites. With a well-designed program ready for implementation, the time had come for the pilot phase.

### Piloting Three Sites

In the summer of 2009, three couples from different parts of the U.S. were called by their local priesthood leaders to serve as Church Service Missionaries and support Pathway. They were tasked with pioneering the program's implementation, with one of them envisioning it as the "rocket ship, taking Church education to the whole world." Their experience was a mix of frustration, excitement, challenges, tests of faith, and wonderful moments. The Pathway team, hopeful and enthusiastic yet perhaps hesitant, launched the three pilot sites in the fall of 2009, with a total of 50 students enrolled. Griffith, having all their contact numbers, also served as the instructor for one of the initial courses. He recalls receiving text messages from students at all hours of the night. The students involved in the pilot differed noticeably from those at BYU-Idaho's rural Rexburg campus. Among the three pilot sites, Manhattan was seen as potentially providing the best insight into the program's success across diverse global cultures.

Securing service missionary couples for the sites sometimes proved more challenging than anticipated. The Manhattan site, for instance, opened without a designated missionary couple in place until a few weeks into the semester. The successful recruitment, vetting, and calling of missionary couples, who would commit to serving for 12-24 months, heavily relied on the support of local priesthood leaders. When these leaders grasped Pathway's vision and potential for their community members, appointing a missionary couple was generally successful. However, when local leaders struggled to comprehend Pathway's purpose and potential, appointing a facilitating missionary couple became a strenuous task.

The initial semester of the pilot phase was described as "rough." Griffith and his secretary, Lynne Landon, managed the pilot's implementation using a very basic website. The organization was in its early stages, with room for improvement and development.

# Training Materials for Pathway Program

Training materials for the students or the missionaries on how the gatherings were to function were essential. Sister Shirley Benjamin served with her husband Arlen Benjamin as the first missionaries officially called to the Pathway program. She recalls not receiving instructions on how gatherings were supposed to work until the evening of their gathering.

Rolling out the first semester of Pathway and managing the three distant sites from Rexburg became an overwhelming task. Griffith was constantly traveling between Rexburg and the distant sites. This, while both he and Landon maintained their previous responsibilities in Continuing Education, placing student teachers at various other distant sites. During one trip to Church Headquarters, Griffith had a morning meeting with President Henry B. Eyring, now a member of the Church's First Presidency, and later that afternoon was found in a small apartment in Salt Lake City cleaning toilets so that a new group of student teachers could move in.

## Benjamin Charles Peterson — Master's Thesis

### Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

In their travels as members of the Quorum of the Twelve, both Henry B. Eyring and David A. Bednar grew increasingly uncomfortable with the idea that the Church Educational System was chiefly serving students from North America. Reflecting on the source of his insight to entertain a worldwide program, Eyring admitted, "I didn't have a vision; I had a feeling. I had a feeling, and I got it from a prophet, I didn't get it from myself." He recalls how Church President Gordon B. Hinckley would verbally "pound" him saying "Why do you think about the haves instead of the have-nots? Why aren't you worried about the have-nots? This is a Church of the have-nots."

Kim B. Clark was attending the Church's General Conference at the beginning of October 2009 where he was writing notes and personal impressions that he received during the various addresses given. During one of the addresses, he wrote the following impression: "We need to extend the pilot." The next Monday Clark discussed his impressions in a meeting with Fenton Broadhead, Henry J. Eyring, Rob Eaton, and Betty Oldham. Oldham recounts those meetings as "revelatory and most enlightening." The original plan was to readdress the pilot program with the Board seven months later, in May. However, only one week later, Clark asked that Eaton prepare a presentation he could present to the Board proposing immediate expansion—and he needed the presentation completed that very day. Two days later, on October 14, Clark shared his impressions with Paul V. Johnson—then Commissioner of Education—and with Henry B. Eyring, both of whom suggested he bring the matter before the Executive Committee later that month.

On October 28, when the first semester of Pathway students was approaching the midterm, Clark entered the Executive Committee meeting with a proposal to expand Pathway by ten sites, with two additional international sites in Puebla, Mexico, and Accra, Ghana. With a large LDS population—numbering more than one million—and as a bordering country to the United States, Mexico was a natural fit for the international pilot. The site in Ghana would give Pathway unique international experience and test them in various ways. Without any hard data or information about whether the program works, whether the students attend or even stay or benefit from the program, the proposal to research international expansion was approved by the Board on November 11, 2009.

J.D. Griffith and Rob Eaton traveled to Salt Lake City to meet with President Henry B. Eyring, Elder Robert D. Hales, Elder Costa, and Elder Carmack, who oversaw the Perpetual Education Fund. They also met with Joe J. Christensen who had overseen the international institute program in 1970. As Christensen reflected on his work forty years earlier, it opened their eyes when they realized the planting and germination of Pathway had been in the works for decades. In addition to the 230 institute buildings the Church operated in North

# Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

In America, there were 324 additional institutes operating overseas. Each had a full-time director, and now almost all of them featured access to high-speed Internet.

## International Delivery Methods

Eaton and Griffith had been debating possible methods by which they could internationally deliver Pathway courses. Their concern was whether to translate the courses and provide them in the students' native languages, or to offer them exclusively in English. They presented their concerns to President Henry B. Eyring, who began to remark on the possibilities of translation technologies that could become so effective that the value of learning English could become diminished. Then he stopped mid-discussion and said, "No, you teach them English. It will not only bless their lives, but it will bless the Kingdom if they know English." He continued, "Language looks like a good anchor—not the language itself, but the process that learning language requires. It's a marvelous introduction into whatever pathway they'll take. It's one of the few things that won't be wasted."

## Expansion Efforts

Eaton then met with priesthood leaders and Church members in Brazil where at one site in Sao Paulo, 613 people were in attendance, followed by another 200 in a second meeting at the same location. In their trip to Ghana on January 26, 2010, Eaton and Griffith were greeted by 100 members who expressed interest in enrolling in Pathway. It was clear that international interest for a Church-sponsored education was far from waning. In Africa, few members had computers or affordable Internet access. They discussed international pricing with Elder Joseph Sitati, a member of the Africa West Area Presidency. Realizing the impossibility of charging African Saints $65 per credit hour, they asked Elder Sitati if they could offer Pathway to Church members in Accra at no cost. Elder Sitati's negative response was accompanied with the comment that the people needed to earn and value their education. His recommendation was that tuition be an affordable stretch. As they later priced worldwide tuition rates, Pathway administrators would now pose the question, "What is an affordable stretch for your members?" to priesthood leaders in every country the program would enter. BYU-Idaho's fundamental purpose with online learning was to "extend the opportunity for a Church-sponsored higher education to as many students as we can."

## Program Objectives

After returning from the site visits, Clark, Eaton, and Griffith found themselves in a setting where they were able to meet with President Henry B. Eyring and discuss the program's future. Griffith recalls preparing a brief report to present to President Eyring updating him on the students' academic progress. As he began to slide the report across the desk to President Eyring, Eyring slid the paper back and expressed his confidence in their ability as a University to teach students academically. What had Eyring's real interest was if the program was successfully delivering the Gospel message into the students' hearts. At that point, Griffith and Eaton modified some of the program's metrics and began looking at the data differently. Academic Start would differ from other public educational programs because its intent and objectives were broader than just taking courses. Its new objectives would be a major and repetitive focus of the Pathway program:

- Help students get the gospel of Jesus Christ deep into their hearts (Faith)
- To become lifelong learners (Learning)
- Support and lead their families in a more productive way (Family)

## Program Expansion and Purpose

The program's international expansion was met with both excitement and anxiety. Henry B. Eyring asserted, "This isn't about education. It's education as a way to take the gospel down into kids' lives. That's the purpose of every Institute or Church School. It's faith-enhancing education." Surely, the program would "lengthen the reach" of Church education. Eyring added, "We need to learn to."

# Help Students Without Lowering the Bar

By making it too easy for students to keep going, they may never change. Strengthening their capacity is crucial. Finding ways for students to see real progress without making it easier is key. The goal is not to lower the bar but to help them recognize their progress. The potential impact is significant.

The possibilities of serving students internationally are vast. For instance, while some domestic employers may not recognize the professional certificates available to Pathway students, many international students could become more immediately employable with a certificate.

## Language Courses

To enroll in Pathway, international students need to have an "intermediate-low" English skill level. While all students have some English-speaking ability, Pathway aims to enhance this capability. This led to the creation of language courses (L-Courses), tailored for students learning English.

These courses, modeled after traditional Academic Start courses, were designed for international and foreign-speaking domestic students. While domestic Pathway students would take a 3-credit standard course and a 2-credit religion course, international students would enroll in a 5-credit L-version course.

## Additional Credits for Communication and Language Skills

Initially, L-courses were developed by BYU-Hawaii contracted employees. Rebecca (Cheney) Morris later played a crucial role in developing these courses. With her assistance, language activities were integrated into the standard course content, creating the L-version of Academic Start courses. These courses were simplified for non-native speakers, included vocabulary exercises, and incorporated a speaking partner component.

## Speaking Partners

As the Pathway pilot expanded, the team grew to seven employees, including Gene Hayes, who managed international Pathway sites. Recognizing the value of language tutoring, the team introduced a requirement for international students to have an English-speaking partner. These partners would engage in weekly 30-minute Skype sessions to converse in English.

## Transitioning from Pilot to Full Implementation

The Pathway team understood the importance of maintaining standards while supporting student progress. They recognized the value of providing opportunities for growth without compromising on quality.

# Learn about Academic Start with only three sites

Though it didn't seem slow, their initial growth was a necessary slow start so that important lessons could be learned as Pathway was scaled to reach across the globe. After approval was given to form a pilot, those first years—even the first months—were filled with lessons that shaped Pathway's future. The program evolved into something that did not bear close resemblance to what was proposed. Though it was vaguely connected to the idea of institutes and online learning, what was being done, Clark acknowledged, was "very different than we imagined."

## Pathway's Expansion

As Pathway was in its first expansion phase, moving from 3 sites to 10 sites, Griffith sought to hire directors to manage sites. Bryan Justesen was hired in June 2010, and Gene Hayes was hired two months later. Still in its pilot phase, Pathway had eventually expanded to 22 domestic sites and 2 international sites by spring 2011. Students now numbered 236, and despite the relatively small challenges, the data coming in reflected success.

An overwhelming majority of Pathway students surveyed indicated that the Pathway Program inspired them to make improvements in their lives ranging from praying with greater faith to attending Church more regularly to improving personal scripture study and family prayer. Ninety-four percent indicated their testimonies had grown stronger; ninety-six responded that they were applying principles learned in Pathway in their daily lives. Ninety-five percent indicated that their confidence in the Lord's ability to help them in their lives had increased as a result of their participation in Pathway (Eaton, "A Brief History of Online and Pathway").

Forty-five percent of students in 2010 had never attended institute prior to Pathway but were now part of regular gospel discussions in weekly institute classes. This data, along with data reflecting improved quality in BYU-Idaho online courses, convinced Clark that Pathway was to now be recognized as an official BYU-Idaho program.

## Benjamin Charles Peterson — Master's Thesis

Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

The Board granted approval in April 2011 for Pathway to remove the pilot tag; however, Board approval would still need to be obtained for additional sites. A few days later, Clark addressed BYU-Idaho faculty members. While reflecting on the creation of Pathway, Clark noted several decades of involvement coming from President Henry B. Eyring:

"It's pretty remarkable to go back to his inaugural address and the 1972 committee that he chaired and other subsequent interactions he's had with several of the presidents, including most recently in his role in the First Presidency. I'm sure it's not a coincidence that he was in the First Presidency when we proposed Pathway because he really shaped it. He's always had this long-standing sense that there was going to be this important role for education throughout the Church and that the Lord would provide the means whereby these institutions could generate courses and knowledge and be able to distribute it to students throughout the world. And he has really shaped that for, going back now, 40 years. And that's been a powerful influence and will have lasting consequences for years to come."

## Over Age 30

The age group for Pathway was originally defined by the institute program (18-30). However, in their first focus groups, Griffith learned that there was a huge need and demand for Pathway among those who were older than 30, who had for whatever reason missed an earlier opportunity to continue their education. In Manhattan, Griffith was approached by a 32-year-old bishop from Brooklyn who was working two jobs to support his family. The man said to Griffith, "I need more education. I need this." It was difficult for Griffith and the others to say no, and yet this same experience happened time and time again. This was happening.

# Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

During the great recession and people were losing their jobs or realizing that they could no longer support their families on their current income. Experiences like this tugged at the hearts of those who oversaw the program, and they fixed their minds on doing something about it.

Clark took the idea to the Board to expand the program to include those who were older than 30. Their education would still include religious education, but it would not take place in institute buildings. Students over 30 years old would be required to enroll each semester in—and pay tuition for—a BYU- Idaho online religion course worth 2 credits. This proposal was approved by the Board on May 25, 2011.

Specified religion courses for this age group have varied, and beginning fall semester 2016, all of these Pathway students will enroll online in three of the four new Cornerstone courses across their three semesters in Academic Start.

## Global Expansion

Kim B. Clark stated that, "BYU-Idaho has a special role in the Church Education System. Its role is to reach broadly to many, many different kinds of students and open up opportunities for them." As Pathway grew the responsibilities to oversee domestic Pathway sites were divided between Bryan Justesen and April Spaulding. With the increase in the number of service missionaries serving throughout the program, Spaulding's responsibilities evolved to become the manager of Missionary Support.

When Justesen was hired to help launch the first expansion of ten new domestic sites his job consisted of cold-calling area seventies, stake presidents, institute directors, and recommended service missionary couples and just "hoping and praying that they would quickly catch the vision" of Pathway. Their experience resembled that of a supervisor in England who was sent to globally expand the seminary and institute program. Of his experience in the early 1970s, he commented: "It was a kind of public relations challenge, because you had to go in and convert the members of the Church to the thoughts and ideas of seminary. So you were selling the program, and selling it to the priesthood leaders." Approaching Pathway's expansion in this way made it seem that Pathway was only a BYU- Idaho educational program. When S&I was expanded, administrators found that support from local priesthood leaders was vital in recruiting students and promoting the program. Employing a similar strategy, Justesen headed the responsibility of working with the area seventies, stake presidents and institute directors, while Spaulding took the role of working with missionaries to ensure they had the necessary support, resources and training.

In the process of expanding to thirteen sites the budding Pathway team learned one of many lessons that would be evident as they labored through the first few phases of Pathway's development. One of the thirteen sites that was being launched was in Twin Falls, Idaho. The site launched with a supportive stake president and a service missionary couple, however the Pathway team had not yet learned much about recruiting students. Enrollment waned at the Twin Falls site, and efforts to recruit enough students to form a cohort collapsed. Recruiting strenuously stretched over eighteen months until a cohort was finally organized at Twin Falls. A few small cohorts existed at that site over the next year or two until the site failed and was closed in 2013. The site reopened in fall 2015 with strong participation. This proved to be an example of the dramatic transformation from Pathway's early days. Previously, Pathway relied more heavily on institute directors and their personal.

# Relationships and Contacts for Recruiting Efforts

The focus of the program shifted from recruiting efforts to running the program under the guidance and vision of priesthood leaders rather than through cold calls.

## Service Missionaries' Role in Program Expansion

- Service missionaries were instrumental in expanding the program at each site.
- Pathway found students through local priesthood leaders and Church service missionaries.
- Service missionaries spread awareness through word of mouth, attending various Church meetings to inform members and leaders about the Pathway program and its benefits.
- Local ward councils discussed how Pathway could benefit individual ward members, leading to recommendations for the program.

## A Self-Selection Model

- New locations were selected based on proximity to existing successful sites.
- The program was presented as an opportunity for individuals to receive quality, Church-sponsored higher education at a low cost.
- Contact with locals before opening a site was primarily through institute directors, with limited contact with priesthood leaders.
- The program needed to be ecclesiastically led to succeed, not just a University program supported by local Church leaders.

## Lessons Learned and Program Evolution

- Initial pilot sites without proper priesthood support struggled and closed.
- Success was achieved in Mesa, Arizona, and Boston by having strong ecclesiastical and priesthood support.
- The program must be ecclesiastically led for success, a lesson that took time to formalize into a strategic policy.

# Benjamin Charles Peterson — Master's Thesis

**Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education**

- President Kim B. Clark emphasized working efficiently with priesthood leaders.
- Clark proposed assigning an agent stake president over the Pathway program to educate other stake presidents and recommend service missionary couples.
- Enrollment significantly increased from 50 to 3,426 students in three years starting fall 2012, indicating a positive change in the program's approach.
- Guidance from Clark played a crucial role in the program's evolution and success.

# Clark's Guidance and Pathway Site Selection Process

Clark's guidance led Justesen to create an application that priesthood leaders could submit if they were interested in seeing Pathway open a site in their area. The application has been modified over time to request specific criteria, and successful Pathway sites have been evaluated so that currently when a site application is received, the rubric can essentially predict the potential success for any given site. This process has uncannily predicted enrollment success.

## Key Criteria for Site Selection

One of the key criteria Justesen and his colleagues look at on an application include the number of stakes in the geographic area. Areas where there is a concentration of LDS stakes in a tighter geographic area make potential for a high-enrolling site. Other areas where the Church may have several stakes that are much more spread out tend to prove less successful. Another key indicator of enrollment potential is the stakes' willingness to provide a service missionary couple to support the new site. The Pathway site application also looks at the local young single adult population and even asks local priesthood leaders to submit an implementation plan suggesting what communication channels or individuals might be involved in their efforts to make the site successful. The biggest lesson learned in the pilot phase was that the success of a site depended entirely upon priesthood engagement.

## Growth and Success Indicators

During the fall 2012 semester, Pathway enrollment had increased from 601 students the previous fall semester to 3,426 students. Synchronously, the number of Pathway service missionaries increased from 62 to 270. This explosive growth was seen by Pathway managers as a result of the process of making Pathway a ministering resource for priesthood leaders. Prior to this growth, Griffith and Justesen knew that they needed to go through priesthood channels if Pathway was going to successfully accomplish its purpose. The question was now how to get priesthood leaders to request Pathway sites in their areas.

## Transition Phase and Approach to Site Selection

After identifying numerous sites, Justesen reached out to priesthood leaders and tried to pique their interest and guide them through the application process. This was a transition phase. No longer was Pathway calling local leaders to announce an approved Pathway site that would be opened in their area. Now, Pathway contacted leaders to educate them about the program and promote the site application.

Griffith, Eaton, and Justesen gathered a list of twelve good potential sites and divided them up and approached the area seventies in those areas to explain Pathway and spark excitement for the program. "Some of them got excited, but most of them didn't." This was a pivotal point where their approach changed. They knew of the potential of each of these areas, but rather than forcing Pathway on those leaders who were not excited about it, they chose to focus efforts on the ones who expressed sincere interest. By approaching the area seventies about the opportunity, it allowed them to vet the leaders and find those who really wanted Pathway and would go out and recruit the stake presidents' support of the program. By the time Pathway was experiencing larger growth in fall 2012, the majority of all Pathway sites were self-selected by priesthood leaders who requested that Pathway be brought to them.

## Quality of Service Missionaries and Leadership Engagement

Self-selected sites also saw greater quality of service missionaries. Soon, as priesthood leaders really caught the vision of Pathway's potential for their Church members, they began recommending former stake presidents and mission presidents as service missionaries. Individuals who had previously served in these capacities knew how to love young single adults and became extremely engaged in the effort to rescue and assist those who had been "left behind."

# Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

As Pathway began to expand into more and more sites, they began working with dozens of area seventies and area presidencies throughout the world. It was apparent that Pathway's most successful growth was natural growth—as an area produced sufficient interest in the program a new site could be opened. With this understanding of organic growth, Clark went to the Board to seek approval for Pathway to perpetually open additional sites in areas overseen by area seventies or area presidencies where Board approval for other sites has already been given. The request was approved, and Pathway sites continued to open at a faster pace. While preparing for fall semester 2015, Pathway sought Board approval for the last time to open a domestic site.

Although Pathway expanded relatively quickly in most parts of the world, the program was slower to enter the Church's Utah areas. Opening sites in Utah was a function that operated differently than the rest of the world. Due to the extremely large LDS population in Utah, Pathway sites in this state were approved through the Presidency of the Seventy. Because of the proximity of the stakes in Utah, Church and program administrators feared that if a site opened, individuals from other areas of the state would possibly attend, resulting in unpredictably large numbers. This meant that Pathway would have to operate cautiously due to the colossal enrollment potential. When the first sites in Sandy and Taylorsville opened in 2012 and 2013, enrollment applications for the sites numbered in the hundreds. Thursday gatherings at the Taylorsville site included ten cohorts—ten classrooms. The Ogden site hosted seventeen cohorts in fall 2015.

Word spread quickly throughout Utah regarding the opportunities Pathway provided. Because penetration into Utah was slow, people were driving from as far as St. George and Logan every week to participate in Pathway. Eventually, other sites opened in Utah, and currently Pathway opened three additional Utah sites for fall semester 2016, bringing the total number of Pathway sites in the State to ten.

## One University

In April 2013, Clark sought to separate Pathway from the University in a way that would allow it to stand on its own and be prepared "for whatever the Lord had in store for the future." It would become difficult to effectively innovate if the program were fully integrated with the University in every way. This led administrators to determine in what ways they required a connection to the University, and what materials and groups they could develop themselves. Pathway and other elements of the Online Initiative had always maintained some connection to BYU-Idaho even when a degree of separation was desired for successful innovation. Pathway was integrated in its reliance on online courses, instructors, and accounting, but formed its own support and advising teams, and even developed its own information system (PATH). With this model, the University knew no details about individual Pathway students until they matriculated and transferred their transcript to the University itself.

This decision allowed the Pathway organization to expand very quickly. Students were enrolling in droves. Such accelerated growth was both celebrated and problematic. Once Pathway students matriculated to an online degree program, Pathway was no longer involved in their educational development. Rather, the students were treated like any other BYU-Idaho student as they began enrolling in Foundations courses and working toward a bachelor's degree. For many students, a curriculum that seemed very applied had suddenly become esoteric and overly academic. Furthermore, many Pathway students were not receiving the training and job skills they needed.

# Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

The campus did not have an online advising group that was made to assist Pathway students. For the first five years of Pathway, students who matriculated to a BYU-Idaho online degree program were assisted by campus advising. Limited certificates were available to these students, they were not always being invited into the certificate programs, and those that were quickly realized that there were too many pre-requisites and too many required credits in each certificate. In the first six years of Pathway, from 2009 until 2015 only six certificates were awarded to Pathway students. Students worldwide were dropping out of the program with 15 to 30 credit hours and no marketable job skills, other than improved English language skills.

## Evolution of Pathway Program

Once Pathway began to expand, University President Kim Clark believed that in order for BYU-Idaho to achieve its most critical goals of serving students online, it must become a critical function embodying nearly every part of campus. "BYU-Idaho simply could not extend a genuine BYU-Idaho experience to students if faculty or administrators saw its online efforts as the sole province of some kind of separate subsidiary who simply had permission to use the BYU-Idaho brand and access to some of its resources." The University renewed efforts to blend Pathway with the University's campus resulting in the creation of a Faculty Online Advisory Council that shaped online learning policies.

Initially, many faculty members struggled to understand the domestic need for a robust online program, when you could simply build more buildings and increase on-campus enrollment. However, they began to understand as they saw the international element and saw that it wasn't affordable to have the whole world fly to Rexburg and that there was no way to build enough buildings to house them all. Even in the initial stages before many faculty were fully committed to the success of the program, Eaton notes that the courses some of them helped develop essentially 'under protest' were quite impressive—a fact he called "extraordinary."

## Solutions and Improvements

Griffith recalls that most solutions to problems faced by Pathway would come in the form of people they would hire, technological advancements, or simple insights through trial and error. There has been a greater effort in the last year to correct this problem and provide advising for Pathway students that is catered to fit their needs. There has also been a recent emphasis on advising students to simultaneously obtain certificates as they work to complete their degrees. As students complete 15 credit hours, they can receive professional certificates that provide marketable academic credentials, improving a student's job prospects. These stackable certificates become part of the associate and bachelor's degree programs and the progress is in the numbers. When Gilbert returned to campus in 2015, fall semester saw that only 7% of international Pathway students were declaring a certificate when they completed Academic Start. During winter semester 2016, that number increased to 37%, and to 57% during spring 2016 semester. Today 93% of all students who recently began Academic Start have already declared a certificate. Similarly, at the beginning of fall semester 2015 only 29 certificates had been awarded in the previous twelve months, and by August 2016 graduation an additional 94 certificates were awarded—nearly approaching the number of certificates awarded in the previous six years combined.

## Online Organization and Integration

In order to make this work, the University set up an online organization at BYU-Idaho that thought only about online students. This organization is chaired by Jon Linford and now assists with the handoff of Pathway students as they extend their education toward an online degree. With this organization in place, Griffith and the Pathway team would again sit in council with online courses and online instruction—both overseen by Linford. For the first time in years, Pathway is no longer separate from the University—rather, it is separate from campus. With an online organization in place, with its own vice-president, the University is able to organize around the online organization. This was critical.

**Benjamin Charles Peterson — Master's Thesis**

# Considering that between BYU-Idaho Online students and Pathway students, more than half of the students enrolled in the University were online students.

During winter semester 2016, 56% of BYU-Idaho's students were enrolled exclusively in online courses. Gilbert estimates that the number will increase to 75%. With this ratio of online students, and a well-organized online organization, no longer would the University be saying, "'This is what we offer on campus—we think it will help you.' We're now saying, 'In Mexico, or Albania, or Russia, or Brazil, these are the needs. These are the career opportunities. How can we give the students an educational experience that will help them get these jobs locally?'" A key element in Pathway's success are the BYU-Idaho Online academic programs—including certificates and degrees. If the online programs did not exist, Pathway students would have much more limited options when they finish Academic Start. But without Pathway, the online programs would not experience burgeoning enrollment they way they do. The two are symbiotic.

## Enhancing Certificate Offerings

In addition to an online organization, Gilbert acknowledged the need for quality certificate offerings. Kendall Peck, now Dean of Online Programs, was assigned solely for the creation of these certificate programs. He counsels with Griffith and with Church Self-Reliance Managers around the world. He enters particular markets and researches demand within each market, and he also counsels with students. The certificate programs created by the University are now a priority and they have begun

## Meeting The Needs Not Only Of On-Campus Students, But Also The Separate Needs Of Their Online Students Worldwide.

Through Pathway, BYU-Idaho began to serve as a "dual-purpose asset in the kingdom." On campus, disciple-leaders were being created through foundational, integrated courses and a student leader learning model that promoted learning "by study and also by faith." This success on-campus was also creating the means, material, ideas and course structure that would allow the University to educate thousands more than would ever come to its campus.

As of January 1, 2015, all Pathway students between 18-30 years old were given the ability to take all three religion courses through their local institute. This reduces the need to pay tuition for the spring semester religion course.

Additionally, when Pathway and BYU-Idaho online students complete eligible institute courses, those credits will now be accepted by BYU-Idaho in fulfillment of the university's graduation requirements rather than serving as only elective credit. Furthermore, these Pathway students who pursue a BYU-Idaho online degree may now take institute courses to satisfy required religion credits, furthering cost savings for each student.

## Path

Efforts to streamline the application process included an online application that is offered through internal software called PATH. With great assistance from Pathway Communication & Curriculum Director, Bryan Pope, the Pathway team sought help from the Church's Information and Communication Services Department (ICS) to design software that would allow priesthood leaders, service missionaries, Pathway students, and administrators to work together. ICS had recently completed initial development on a program for Seminaries and Institutes called WISE.

PATH allows students a very user-friendly experience when applying to Pathway and authenticates students with their LDS account login information—the same

# Information Members Use to Log into Church Websites and Software

Information members use to log into any Church website or software. It also allows service missionaries access to information regarding students' enrollment and other site-specific administration tools.

Amid the roll-out of PATH, it was decided that Pathway's website, which had been running for over a year, would be moved to the lds.org domain, causing an unexpected uptick to site visits at lds.org. Holding the website at the Church's official domain brands the program as an official Church offering, and gives Pathway immediate Church sanction for any who may have seen the program as solely a BYU-Idaho endeavor.

## Area and Missionary Support Managers

Area managers work closely with local priesthood leaders to identify current Pathway service missionaries to serve as leaders over a site or a collection of sites—often called zones. Area managers train the missionary leaders who in turn train and manage the responsibilities of new service missionaries in their respective sites or zones. These leader missionaries—site and zone leaders—deliver new missionary onboarding trainings, workshops, and devotionals that inform others about the program. Site leaders are responsible for between 10 and 15 missionary companionships, while zone leaders oversee between 30 and 50 companionships. These leaders work to foster relationships with local Church leaders, coordinate efforts to call and release new service missionaries and find new students. Local church leaders provide the impetus at the local level. This pattern allows the program to minimize operating and travel costs as much of the training is taking place locally by site and zone leaders.

## Challenges of International Expansion

Rather than working with area seventies as the domestic team did, Hayes and his area managers worked directly with area presidencies. They found that working with the area presidency was much like working with a CEO. If the area presidency was "on board" they ran the area and could get the area seventies and stake presidents to align. Cooperation of priesthood leaders in foreign countries would be critical to Pathway's international success. In countries such as Albania, the program received immediate support from local leaders simply because Pathway would educate Albanian citizens without removing them from their homeland. A mission president in Albania informed Pathway representatives that over 90% of Albanian-born missionaries who are called to serve outside of their country never return to live in Albania because they find better opportunities for education and employment outside the country.

Hayes made it a point never to penetrate a market where the area presidency had not requested a Pathway site. He insists, "Unless the area presidency calls us, we will never go there." Pathway operates in 12 of the 14 operating areas of the Church. The two areas without a Pathway site are Asia and Asia North.

Another cultural barrier Hayes faced was the way individual cultures do business with each other. In foreign nations it was obviously far more important to establish a friendly relationship with the priesthood leaders. "You don't just formally have a meeting and only talk business. You have to develop the relationship first—that is essential." Hayes became effective at catering to the Church's sub-culture in various areas of the world. It seemed that if Pathway were to succeed internationally, it would not happen by taking a cookie-cutter approach to each area.

Within the Pathway team this need to cater Pathway's roll-out to each individual area caused some turbulence. Some questioned why Hayes would need to develop a different way of doing things in each area. Hayes was convinced, however, that he would not succeed if he took the domestic program, simply translated it, and

# Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

## Virtual Pathway

In some countries, legal restraints and long travel distances complicate Pathway operations in existing sites. In Russia, some students travelled two hours, and up to 120 miles each way to gather with their Pathway group. Once they arrived, legal regulations governed how the chairs could be set up, and the cohort was not allowed to set up a whiteboard in the room.

This extreme distance, further complicated by strict government oversight forced Pathway to seek innovative ways to operate Pathway in Russia and various areas of the world.

In April 2014, Pathway received approval from Paul V. Johnson, Commissioner of Church Education, to address these limitations by offering a virtual Pathway pilot. This pilot began running in the Russia Yekaterinburg Mission. Phase one was initiated in September 2014 where ten students gathered via videoconference in a gathering experience similar to all Pathway students. This pilot proved successful in the area, and seven of the ten original students completed Pathway in July 2015 with an average GPA of 3.8. By February 2016, eight sites were meeting via virtual gatherings in six eastern European countries including Russia. Now all Russian students are participating in Pathway virtually. Virtual Pathway has also been seen as a revenue stream that could potentially off-set the anticipated plateauing of domestic sites. As of fall 2016, the virtual pilot had expanded to all countries in the Church's Europe and Europe East Areas where Pathway sites have been approved, as well as to the Caribbean. Virtual Pilot students across the globe now number 192.

## Textbook Problem

On April 2, 2014 Kim B. Clark announced that Pathway was Transitioning from a successful start-up to a large organization. Clark stated that even though Pathway had already experienced significant growth, greater demands and development were on the horizon. At the time, Griffith was working through issues concerning program retention in Ghana. A large number of students were exiting the program. Griffith received an email from Elder Legrand R. Curtis,

## International Expansion Challenges

Hayes translated the presentation that he made when he opened a new site into both Spanish and Portuguese. And if he was giving the presentation in a country where another language was spoken, he had an interpreter. He saw that the program must be customized and personalized for the area it will serve.

International expansion requires significant research as each country has unique government regulations. Pathway performs a full legal and regulatory review for each country where a site is entertained. The Pathway team works closely with Church's office of general counsel and attorneys at Salt Lake City law firm Kirton Mcconkie to conduct country-specific research prior to crossing borders with these new international sites. Some area presidencies have requested Pathway sites multiple times, however due to legal, political, social and financial barriers of entry, the program has been put on hold in those countries.

Some countries require that BYU-Idaho become accredited within the country. This would require, in many instances, local employees and a local business entity thus creating regulatory issues and financial concerns that have heretofore prevented Pathway's entry into such countries. Where the Church is the entity with local presence and facilities on the ground, entering these countries could put the Church at risk. Hayes' team revisits requests in these countries every six months or so, however, until these barriers are removed, the countries remain on hold (see Appendix 3, Table 2).

# President of the Africa West Area

President of the Africa West Area. Curtis shared the following concern:

> The aspect of the Pathway experience that gives us concern is how well the Pathway online educational experience fits the needs of young single adults in West Africa…We enthusiastically support our young people receiving an education, but we are not in a position to say that Pathway is a good option for any particular young single adult, and we do not want involvement by us to signal to any of them that it is. We are not in a good position to assure students that Pathway is a good investment of their time and money.

## Communication from the Area President

This communication from the area president of the first international site was sobering to the Pathway team. Though the program had proved successful in serving over 27,000 students, it was impossible to ignore the fact that a BYU-Idaho degree might have little intrinsic value on foreign soil.

## Resolving Issues

Pathway began to pour time and resources into resolving this looming problem. This effort became known internally as "the Curtis effect." While global student matriculation from Pathway to a BYU-Idaho online degree was 40%, Curtis' concern centered around the fact that many Ghanaians were dropping out of the online program, leaving them with exhausted financial credit but no credentials. The problem was multi-faceted. After matriculating into an online degree program, even though tuition rates for Pathway students remained consistent with those of Academic Start, the students were no longer gathering on a weekly basis. That loss of peer support from fellow students and service missionaries proved detrimental. Furthermore, matriculated students were being advised to enroll in BYU-Idaho Foundations courses including American Foundations.

## Textbook Cost Issues

Also problematic were the cost of textbooks. For the first several years, this became a real problem for matriculated Pathway students. Having developed a close friendship with one of the first Pathway students in Ghana, Griffith worked to coach the student as he matriculated into an online degree program, as did many other international students. Griffith noticed that this particular student failed to register for his next semester. Griffith looked further into the situation and discovered that the issue was a $212 textbook that was left unpaid. The real problem was that the course the textbook was being used for cost only $60—course materials were costing nearly four times that of the course itself. After a closer look, Griffith discovered that matriculated Pathway students were dropping out left and right because of this "textbook problem."

## Efforts to Reduce Textbook Costs

Following this discovery, the University began a joint effort with Pathway and the University Store to reduce textbook costs. Part one of this joint effort was a textbook subsidy pilot funding textbook costs for international students through philanthropy efforts. In its first semester—fall 2014—philanthropy funds had provided course materials for 115 students. These students, who were pursuing an online business or computer information technology degree, lived in countries where Pathway tuition was less than $41 per credit-hour. The pilot had plans to provide for all international students during winter semester 2015, and has since reached that goal by expanding to cover most international students in all major programs.

## Moving to Online Textbooks

All along, there was a desire in the Online Initiative to move to online textbooks, and at this point BYU-Idaho faculty began seeking more creative ways to use textbooks and one instructor decided to create his own textbook. Excitement over his book that ultimately cost only $11 was short-lived when the cost to ship it to Russian students was $68. Naturally, thoughts have pointed to using online textbooks, but not all textbooks have an online version. Griffith came across an article co-authored by John Hilton III, an assistant professor of religion at BYU who specializes in open educational resources. One article by

**Benjamin Charles Peterson — Master's Thesis**

**Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education**

# Hilton's Research and Pathway Initiatives

Hilton concluded that if an organization could create a sustainable business model using open educational resources, the potential savings to students is enormous.

At the time of Curtis' message, only 17 percent of the BYU-Idaho bookstore's textbook offerings were available digitally. The textbook problem was resulting in a Ghanaian dropout rate of 55% after matriculation. Griffith used some of Hilton's research to urge University faculty and administrators to seek an effective solution to this problem. Though the subsidy pilot has proved beneficial, it would require much more funding in the years to come as Pathway continues to grow internationally. The second part of the joint effort that brought about the subsidy pilot will be an effort to charge a consolidated materials fee that will be a percentage of tuition for all online students. This new BYU-Idaho Online policy will ensure that all online courses eliminate the need for a textbook and have instead what they call course materials. Those materials will be digital and affordable. The University may not realize this goal until fall 2017 or perhaps later, and until then are continuing to subsidize and ship textbooks to students around the world.

## Academic Advising

Initially, academic advising was provided to students through the University. When Pathway separated from campus in 2013, they created their own network of academic advisors, headed by Steve Thomas who had worked previously with the University academic advising office and the Academic Discovery Center. Thomas' team of Pathway advisors catered their work to the needs and circumstances of students in varied situations around the world. To be sure, their service to students was specialized. Advising for on-campus students simply would not serve Pathway students well—their background and situations oftentimes seemed a world entirely separate from the traditional on-campus student. Naturally, when Pathway students matriculated to an online degree program and were handed off to university academic advisors, it proved problematic.

When Pathway was rejoined with the University and an Online Development Council was organized, they were charged with the goal to seek ways to make the online experience as similar as possible to the on-campus experience. The Online Development Council reported gaps in the online vs. campus experience in areas such as IT systems, curriculum, advising, and support services. Pathway worked closely with campus academic advising beginning winter semester 2015 to assist them in localizing the course sequencing for Pathway students. Additional advisors and students were hired to help fill in the gap. BYU-Idaho academic advisors and Pathway advisors addressed the complexity of matriculation handoffs and projected related needs based on nuances in completion sequences across various areas. Working together, these groups also reached out to at-risk students and provided country-specific advising solutions. Students were advised to seek as their first option a professional certificate that could be completed in only five courses, all of which would count toward a BYU-Idaho bachelor's or associate degree. A stackable certificate also offered students opportunities to find or improve employment while they continue pursuing additional education.

Pathway Advising additionally worked to develop proactive strategies that are directed at identifying and engaging at-risk students in order to help them understand their options after they complete Academic Start.

On March 30, 2016 in a Pathway staff meeting, Griffith announced that the University was about to make a change. University academic advising and Pathway advising would then become one entity and it would operate as the University's Academic Advising office.

# The team launched a new campaign in winter semester 2016 called "Give Me Five."

The campaign's aim was meant to encourage and educate students about the benefits of earning a professional certificate along their path to receiving a BYU-Idaho online associate or bachelor's degree. Each certificate can be received by taking five courses, or approximately 15 credit hours.

## Sustainability

Tuition pricing for Pathway was originally offered at $65 per credit hour domestically, and as little as $10 per credit hour internationally. Pathway administrators set forth a deliberate strategy to keep the domestic price at or below $65 perpetually. However, in spring 2016 pricing was adjusted to $68 per credit hour domestically and some international sites saw a decrease in tuition. Domestic Pathway tuition is still very low, but because the $68 per credit rate is higher than break-even, domestic Pathway tuition funds the enrollment of additional international students who pay much less in tuition, contributing to the program's global sustainability.

Because Pathway utilized an infrastructure that was for the most part preexisting, including student advisors and technology, fixed costs to run the program were minimal. The fixed costs associated with Pathway are essentially the costs of course development. The courses are rigorous and go through a review process. Courses go through a semester of preparation, a semester of development, and a semester of piloting. That process can get expensive (see Appendix 2, figures 8 & 9). Reducing the burden of those higher costs is the University's ability to share those costs across all students both on campus and online. Thus, the fixed-cost per course on a per student basis is very, very low. Domestically, and after fixed costs, the program is generally self-sustaining. The pricing for a portion of international students needs some support however, either from campus, additional tithing resources, or through philanthropy fundraising. Considering the operations of Pathway, online programs, and on-campus programs, the way BYU-Idaho keeps costs down on all three is to have all three working in tandem. Pathway is therefore symbiotic to online and online is symbiotic to campus. The only limit to the growth of Pathway seems to be the requirement that Pathway students must be LDS members.

## Members Of Other Faiths Pilot

Beginning in fall 2012, a small number of individuals who were not members of the Church were allowed to enroll in Pathway at its Boston site. Soon after, Pathway administrators allowed the Riverside, California to participate in this Non-LDS Student Pilot. By fall 2014, the two programs enrolled 15 non-LDS students and retained only six of them. Despite a low retention rate, the pilot saw three of those six students make the choice to be baptized and join the Church. All pilot students were required to have close ties to the Church through a family member or close friend. Each participant's application was individually reviewed by the BYU-Idaho President's Executive Group. In October 2014, approval was requested to extend the pilot to five more domestic sites in order to ascertain the ability of Pathway to bless the lives of non-Latter-day Saints with minimal negative effects on other students.

Pilot students were held to the same expectations as all Pathway students, including living by BYU-Idaho's Honor Code and participating in all required religion courses and religious group discussions. Tuition for these students remained consistent with other Pathway students. Forty-seven students enrolled in this pilot during fall 2015. A survey of the students who had thus far participated in the pilot revealed that nearly all of them were satisfied with their experience and would recommend Pathway to other non-LDS students. Two-thirds of them reported stronger faith in Jesus Christ because of Pathway.

# Overall Completion of Each Semester

Overall completion of each semester was lower for non-LDS students, however, total matriculation was not far below the LDS matriculation rate.

# Online Instructors

According to Clark Gilbert, "One of the hallmarks of a BYU-Idaho education is the personal investment of faculty who unapologetically build their focus on teaching and advising students." Experience has shown that finding online instructors, though more difficult for some disciplines, has simply always worked and that the Lord "calls people to it."

The process of hiring online course instructors has been fairly consistent over time. Pathway course instructors are part of a large group of remote online adjunct instructors. In order for BYU-Idaho Online to employ residents in a particular state, there has to have been a business presence established in that state. As of the end of 2015, BYU-Idaho remote instructors were hirable in 21 U.S. states. Administrators desire to be able to hire in all 50 states eventually. Current restraints include navigating regulatory requirements and the time-consuming process of setting up business entities.

In fall 2015, BYU-Idaho employed 1,200 remote adjunct instructors who teach 25-50 students in each course section.

## Pathway: A Program For The Kingdom

After serving as President of BYU-Idaho for five years, Clark recalled observing members of the Church Board of Education over approximately 60 Board meetings as prophets, seers, and revelators who had caught a vision of Pathway that was far beyond the scope of the current program. He describes the Board's sentiments of Pathway as a "palpable feeling of inspiration." Clark was also known to repetitively assert that "Pathway is not for the University—Pathway is for the Kingdom"—a phrase he coined from Russell M. Nelson, then of the Quorum of the Twelve.

A great key to Pathway's success involves the principle of gathering. The gathering component has proven so successful, that BYU-Idaho administrators are encouraging faculty to seek ways to include a post-Pathway gathering component in the online degree programs. In these gatherings students could gather weekly or monthly with local students in their respective disciplines. These gatherings could be used to network, work on resumes, find mentors, gain internships, or a way to form virtual study groups.

In Phoenix and Mexico, a pilot has been launched to gather BYU-Idaho online matriculated students. Phoenix has 1,800 online students and Mexico has 1,100 students and 70 pathway sites. With a population of students equivalent to a small community college, it opens opportunities for the University to employ innovative strategies. In March 2016, online-degree-seeking students in the Phoenix area gathered for the first-ever BYU-Idaho Connections Conference. Over 500 online students, instructors, alumni, Church leaders, Pathway students, missionaries, and guests enjoyed the opportunity to network and hear from University President, Clark Gilbert. University administrators anticipate holding similar events quarterly in various areas of the world where there exists a high concentration of Pathway and online students. Another conference was held in Mexico City in August 2016.

With Pathway and online students rapidly increasing in clustered areas across

# The Globe, BYU-Idaho, and the "Spirit of Ricks"

The Globe, BYU-Idaho is evolving into a distributed interactive network. The clustering of students provides the University with unique opportunities to serve the students in ways that were previously not possible. University and Online administrators are determined to continue innovative efforts to reach out to individuals worldwide in a highly personalized manner. This approach at BYU-Idaho is known as the "Spirit of Ricks."

## "Spirit Of Ricks" In Pathway

Pathway's foundation is based on three pillars that aim to "reach out to lift up":
1. Faith - instill the gospel in students' hearts
2. Learning - help students become proficient learners
3. Family Leadership - prepare students to lead and support families

Through these objectives, Pathway aims to build students' confidence in themselves and in the Lord's ability to assist them. It helps them acquire skills, learn doctrines, and strengthen values that empower them to be better parents, providers, citizens, and disciples of Jesus Christ.

Pathway's success is attributed to the type of education it offers. Unlike traditional programs, Pathway was developed after consulting with students and local priesthood leaders to address their actual needs.

During a visit to the Boston Pathway site in 2011, Peter Williams, the curriculum development director, witnessed a diverse group of students gathered in a stake center. Despite differences in age, nationalities, accents, height, and weight, the students worked together harmoniously. They collaborated on solving algebra problems in a supportive environment, demonstrating mutual respect and a willingness to help one another succeed.

Clark Gilbert, who assumed the presidency of BYU-Idaho in 2015, emphasized that Pathway not only provides strong academic options but also fosters spiritual growth. Pathway students deepen their commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ, learn essential skills, and enhance discipleship. The cohort model encourages camaraderie among students, enabling them to support each other and create a genuine BYU-Idaho experience without physically being on campus.

Kim Clark highlighted the impact of offering a church-based educational opportunity through Pathway, stating that it instills hope, strengthens faith, and fosters confidence in individuals. This leads to increased activity and involvement in their faith, benefiting families, neighborhoods, communities, and the Church as a whole.

**Title:** Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

Following their visits to Pathway sites in Ogden, Utah, and Mexico, Clark Gilbert and Online Vice-President Jon Linford were moved by the overwhelming gratitude expressed by Pathway students. Gilbert shared a story of a young man who initially lacked confidence but, through his Pathway experience, grew in faith and self-assurance. The long-term impact of Pathway extends to families, strengthening faith, setting examples for children, and fostering leadership within the Church and communities.

# Pathway's Impact on Student Matriculation

The decision of students to not continue their education is often influenced by various factors such as relocation, employment changes, illness, lack of interest, or other life circumstances. A survey conducted in 2015 among non-matriculating students who completed the year of Academic Start sheds light on the reasons why students opt not to pursue a BYU-Idaho online degree. Here are some key findings:

- **Standard Version Students**:
- 21% cited time commitment as the reason for not matriculating

Approximately 80% of Pathway students who successfully complete the program go on to matriculate into a BYU-Idaho online program. Among those who choose not to matriculate online, 4% of standard version students opt for matriculation at BYU-Idaho's campus or another educational institution. Similarly, 16% of non-matriculating L-version students enroll in educational programs elsewhere. Survey responses from non-matriculated students indicate that between 43% and 48% of them are very likely to eventually matriculate into a BYU-Idaho online program.

By the fall semester of 2016, over 12,000 Pathway students had matriculated to enroll in online programs. Approximately 9% of these students have already received either a certificate or a degree. As of October 2016, Pathway students had been awarded 337 bachelor's degrees, 590 associate degrees, and 204 certificates, with 169 certificates being awarded since December 2015.

## Pathway's Growth and Mission

The growth of Pathway shows no signs of slowing down. BYU-Idaho and Pathway have collaborated to revolutionize undergraduate education on a global scale. Through "innovation by revelation," they have extended the blessings of education beyond the campus to individuals worldwide.

## Frugality and Faith in Education

Education is a cornerstone for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, intertwined with the Gospel of Jesus Christ for eternal significance. Pathway's development, as highlighted by key figures, transcends mere human innovation. J.D. Griffith, a pivotal figure in Pathway, acknowledges a higher force propelling the program's success, emphasizing its role in fostering learning, hope, commitment, and conversion. Pathway's approach brings education to individuals in a personal manner, offering opportunities previously unavailable and instilling hope in those seeking higher education.

An exit survey conducted with departing Pathway students reveals that 92% of them experience increased confidence in their academic abilities. Moreover, the average GPA of domestic matriculated Pathway students has consistently surpassed that of other online student categories in equivalent classes over the past three years.

## Insights from an Interview

In an interview, Clark describes the essence of the "Church of Jesus Christ" philosophy, where simplicity is enriched by the Savior's love, His Spirit, devoted Latter-day Saints, tithing funds supporting institutes, and the gospel message. This amalgamation creates a remarkable educational experience. Despite its profound impact, the curriculum at its core remains straightforward. Practical courses like life skills training, including budgeting, are integral components of the program.

# How to Study, How to Learn, and How to Organize

You teach them math and English, and you do it in the English language and that's all it is, but it has an enormous impact on people.

# This Institution

This institution, where frugality will continue to be a guiding spiritual and temporal principle, has been given by the Lord's prophets just what it needs to perform its divinely appointed role in His kingdom.

The university is on a steady, upward course that will allow it to play a remarkable role in the Church and the world.

Frugality is foundational to Pathway's success. Pathway began by relying on an existing infrastructure of meetinghouses and S&I buildings throughout the world. Pathway also housed their first home office in Rigby Hall—previously a dormitory for male students. As the program staff expanded, more space was needed and the offices were moved in September 2012 to the second floor of Biddulph Hall—another quasi renovated dormitory. Some walls in the building were knocked out, but sinks still remain in many of the offices. In my first visit to Pathway's headquarter offices I sat around a table with Pathway's managing director J.D. Griffith on his first day in his "new office." The cold office space—an old maintenance closet—had just been cleaned out and painted to become an office for the chief Pathway employee. A walk down the hall to the Pathway copy room may have previously resembled a walk to the dormitory showers—because that is exactly what it was. Around the tiled corner of the entrance was a copy machine sitting in the doorway of a shower stall. Pathway's operations in themselves mirror Henry B. Eyring's words spoken at BYU-Idaho in 2001. He said, "The expectation is clearly that inspired and frugal people will find ways to bless more students at ever lower cost per student….Your sacrifice will bring down the blessings of heaven." Pathway has certainly modeled the pattern of "innovating with scarce resources and treating all they have as if it were the Lord's."

In addition to increasing the spirituality and self-reliance of faculty members and students, Pathway is also building and preparing teachers and leaders who do and will yet serve in the Church. In an interview with Commissioner Kim B. Clark, he emphasized with some vigor the vast number of Church leaders around the world—including bishops and stake presidents—who for various reasons enroll in Pathway and then use it to benefit both their families and the thousands of people they serve. Pathway it seems, is for the Kingdom.

## Conclusion: A Gateway To The Ces Global Education Initiative

Researching the global expansion of Church education through the Pathway program has been richly enlightening. Throughout the writing process, I was determined to maintain an objective view of Pathway and avoid a hagiographic approach. It has proven all but impossible, however, not to feel the spirit and catch the vision of what this program is, does, and will yet do. There is indeed a heavenly hand that moves this effort at its ever-hastening pace. While researching this project I often wondered why I too had been "called to Pathway" as the topic of this work.

When Clark first arrived at BYU-Idaho he set out three imperatives for the University to increase the quality of education, lower relative costs, and serve more students. Academic Start has shown how to do that on a global size—on any scale.

Pathway: A Gateway to Global Church Education

The whole purpose of BYU-Idaho has been to lead these students to find success as disciple-leaders. That institution has matured and developed innovative approaches to learning and teaching with a focus on increasing the number of students it could serve, increasing the quality of experience and lowering costs. The University is student-centered, with a desire to prepare disciple-

# Leaders Prepared for a Specific Time and Season

Other Church universities have a different role in CES and will be utilized in offering various degrees and certificates as part of the Global Initiative, but serve a general purpose separate from that of BYU-Idaho. The Lord has been working on this institution for a very long time. He has held it out for this time and season. Observing the change that had taken place on the Rexburg campus from 2001 to 2006, a Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities accreditation representative remarked, "This is a miracle. What is happening here in just five years is nothing short of a miracle. We have never seen it before. Someone needs to write the story." BYU-Idaho continued to innovate and transform through the Learning Model, Foundations courses, a three-semester track system, the online initiative, and ultimately Pathway.

## The Pathway Team's Perspective

The Pathway team seems to shout in unison the idea mentioned by Paul in 1 Corinthians 3:6-8, "I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor." Each member of the team is cautiously modest about taking credit for the creation and success of Pathway. They share Eaton's sentiments when he stated:

> We were blessed to have a sense from the outset imparted to us by others and above all, by the Spirit, that we were doing stuff that matters and that we needed to get the Lord's help to do it right. And that was an incredible blessing to be a part of something that God cared about so much that He would give so much help to accomplish. But it was clear to us that we were just instruments in planting and watering and that God was the one giving the increase. But we prayed and hoped all along that there would be great increase from this, and still think that the best stuff lies ahead.

Regardless, each individual who has contributed to Pathway's success had been prepared for their specific roles. This is clearly seen when observing the preparation and contribution of Kim Clark. When he left the Harvard Business School, many outside the Church were baffled by his move, while many within the Church may have also thought, "How is the most academically credentialed individual ever to lead a Church university going to Rexburg?"

Pathway's growth continues to accelerate, and considering the probable impact of the Global Initiative, enrollment will continue to spike for years to come—perhaps perpetually. The 1939 statement by Milton Bennion that "the educational program of the church today is a consistent expansion of the theories promulgated by its founders," is still true today. And the words revealed so long ago to the Prophet Joseph Smith to teach of things both in heaven and in earth, and to seek learning by study and also by faith are now becoming a genuine reality for many worldwide Church members—and even non-LDS individuals—as Pathway assists them in finding their own academic path. This program seems destined to continue to flourish. If it continues to progress along its designed course, it will continue to change untold lives and as a result, families will be fortified, faith will flourish, and a people will be prepared. "Pathway is a miracle, it's just amazing."
