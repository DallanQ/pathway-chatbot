# Helping Students Select A Certificate Shepherding/Ministering

## Selecting A Certificate

### HOW SHOULD YOU HELP A STUDENT?

During PC 102, students will register for PC 103 and their first certificate course. Your role in this process consists of:

- Realizing that students are making difficult, life-changing choices.
- Becoming informed about the choices students can make.
- Being ready to discuss choice options in an informed way if approached by a student.

### HOW SHOULD YOU HELP A STUDENT?

You may be asked by a student about certificates and course options. Remember, it is not your role to give strong support for one choice over another. You help the student consider the positive and negative aspects of each choice.

Listen carefully and try to ask inspired questions. In this process you will help students learn the important life skills of self-evaluation and decision-making.

Consider reviewing the degree list so that you are informed about the choices available to students. See the BYU-Pathway website.

### ASKING QUESTIONS

Ask questions like the ones below if a student comes to you for advice:

- What kinds of employment opportunities would each certificate help you find?
- Do the certificates you are interested in build on your current skills and gifts?
- Do you feel you have a long-term interest in this area?
- Will the certificate have value in your local area? Would you have to move to take advantage of your certificate?
- Have you approached the Lord prayerfully seeking counsel on this question?
- Have you counseled with your spouse on this matter (if the student has one)?

### DEVELOPING AND PRACTICING SKILLS

In making selections, students are practicing skills they will use again and again in their future lives.

As they learn these skills, you should remind the student to accompany logical thought with prayer. Prayer becomes an important part of making choices and a valuable habit.
