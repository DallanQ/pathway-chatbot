## Forming Team Project Groups

**WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?**
Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, and Zone Leaders

**PURPOSE:**
This article introduces the PC 102 team project and covers your role in the project. You will learn when to create groups, who creates them, and how to create them. You will learn what tools will help you to create the group master list.

### Overview
Missionaries organize the student groups for the PC 102 Team Project.

- Groups for the team project are students that come from your gathering group.
- Students should be with the same group throughout the project.
- Help group members make connections with each other (e.g., help them know how to communicate outside the gathering as needed).

**WHAT IS THE TEAM PROJECT?**
BYU-Pathway has interviewed employers around the world, and they report that they need employees who know how to work in teams.

The team project is to create a proposal for a business that sells a drink called lemonade. Students will work on individual parts of the plan each week, and then put it all together in a Powerpoint presentation that they will present to the banker when they ask her for a loan.

Students will submit the weekly project assignments individually, even though they are working in groups. Instructions are found in the PC 102 course.

**WHEN ARE GROUPS CREATED?**
Group creation happens in the following weeks:

- Week 3 for PC 102

Please see the gathering agenda for Week 3 for more information.

**WHO FORMS THE GROUPS?**
You, the missionary, form the groups. Please follow these guidelines closely.

- Assign everyone to a group: Each student should be in a group, even if they are not present at the gathering.
- Keep groups to 4-5 people: It's hard for all to contribute if groups are too big. If they are too small, there can be issues if someone doesn't participate.
- Balance groups: Do not form a group just with people who have not come very often or at all to the gatherings.
- Create a master list: You and the lead student should create a list of who is in which group once they are formed. (Remember, students should be with the same group)

## WHAT SHOULD BE USED TO CREATE THE GROUP MASTER LIST?

You decide how to best create a master list. Consider creating:

- Google doc
- Word or Excel file
- a post to your group's communication channel (Whatsapp, Facebook, etc.)
- an email to the group
- a clipboard and paper (in-person groups)
