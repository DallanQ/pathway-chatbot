**### Introduction**  
Canvas is where you take courses with BYU\-Pathway Worldwide. You go there to understand course requirements, access readings, take quizzes, and submit assignments. Every course you take will have an instructor who will help you succeed. They will communicate with you through Canvas.

If you are a new student , you will not have access to all the Canvas features until the Saturday before the term begins. You will also not have access to the Canvas Mobile App until the term begins. For now, you can access the [PC 101 Sample Course](https://byui.instructure.com/courses/147332/modules) on a web browser using a computer or mobile device to practice some important things.

**### Practice**  
You can practice by following the steps below, or you can simply click around the sample course to see what is there. Note that there are some buttons and menus that you won’t be able to access because you can’t yet sign in.
