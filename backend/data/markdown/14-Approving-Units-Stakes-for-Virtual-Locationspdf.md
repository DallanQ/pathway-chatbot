# Approving Units/Stakes For Virtual Locations Path For Pathwayconnect

Note: This task can only be performed by individuals in the following roles: Area Coordination Missionary and Area Manager.

Review the units and add newly created stakes to the authorized units for each location when setting up the new term.

Approving a location locks student enrollment to locations and programs to specific stakes.

Once locations and programs are in place and active, any student can apply to that location unless the units for the location are approved for eligible stakes. Authorize units to prevent misassignments from areas around the world.
