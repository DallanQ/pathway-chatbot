## Byupathway.Org

Millions of Church members throughout the world don't have a degree. Why?

Because it costs too much, they lack confidence, or they don't have access to Quality Higher Education.

With Byu-Pathway Worldwide, Everyone Can Access Higher Education.

# Low Cost & Adaptive Pricing

Tuition is approximately half the cost of traditional universities.

# Spiritual & Academic Confidence

BYU-Pathway Worldwide inspires hope, opening new opportunities to learn by study and by faith.

# Online & Universally Accessible

Courses and programs are completely online. All you need is access to the Internet to be able to participate — anywhere in the world.

# Byu-Pathway Programs

Pathwayconnect is a one-year, reduced-cost online program that prepares students to start or finish a degree by building spiritual confidence and teaching foundational academic skills. After Pathwayconnect, students can apply their course credits toward a degree at the same lower price.

# Courses

Each term, students take a manageable courseload of academic and religious education. All course credits count toward future certificates and degrees offered through BYU-Pathway Worldwide, in partnership with BYU-Idaho and Ensign College. Also, non-native English speakers can improve their English during Pathwayconnect.

- Professional Studies

### Certificate First

Students start with a job-ready certificate — typically just five courses. Out of the students who complete certificates, 72% receive immediate job improvement. Certificate completers are also significantly more likely to continue toward a bachelor's degree.

## Degrees

Degrees are built by stacking certificates — so no credits are ever lost.

### Earnings Impact

1. By starting with a certificate first, students start building employable skills, immediately increasing earning potential.

2. After the first certificate, an associate degree is built from a second certificate plus general education courses.

3. A bachelor's degree is then built from a third certificate plus more general education courses, with increased income potential.

## Byupathway.Org

Students earn multiple credentials for the same cost and time it would have taken to earn only a bachelor's degree.
