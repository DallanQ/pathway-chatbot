## Putting The Problem In Perspective

You may detect or be made aware that a student has a problem with the subject matter (content). You can help by putting the problem into perspective, calming the student, and helping him or her deal with their emotions.

Encourage the student to relax, to think of the problem logically, to bring emotions back into control, and to approach the problem with prayer and pondering.

## Re-Visiting The Subject Matter

You might consider encouraging the student to review the lesson resources more slowly and in a calmer state of mind, trying to see the content with fresh eyes.

By reducing the emotional interference, a re-visiting of the course material with increased confidence and calm may produce insights overlooked.

## Listening And Asking Questions

Often as we listen carefully to the student and ask appropriate questions (as guided by the Spirit) the student can be brought to find a solution to their own problems and plan some steps to resolve the problem.

In this process try not to give direct advice. Your role is to support the student's own decision-making and self-reliance processes. Students realizing they are solving their own problems may experience an increase in self-confidence.

## Seeking Assistance From Peers

Consider encouraging students to seek assistance from their group if their personal resources and re-visitation of the instruction do not provide an answer to the problem.

A fellow student in the group may have encountered and overcome a similar problem and be a resource.

You may help the student by suggesting some names from the group. A peer may have a simple answer, expressed in language that unlocks the problem.

## Contacting The Instructor

Remind the students that contacting their instructor is appropriate. Instructors will have insight based on the student's previous work or may have received questions about the same topic from other students.

The instructor can communicate with the student to provide support and guidance.

# Seeking Tutoring Help

If these steps have not solved the student's difficulty, tutoring is an option. Tutoring is accessed through the student resources module in Canvas. Tutoring is a precious resource, because it requires one-on-one contact, sometimes over time.

Tutoring services are designed to be used by those who truly need them, and they should be used if failure seems imminent. Tutoring may have already been recommended by an instructor. If not, the you may recommend it to a student.

### Requesting A Tutor

Students can follow the instructions on the Online Tutoring Resources page to request a tutor.

Tutoring is sometimes a good solution to problems that require personal attention to an individual student, and in extreme cases, you may be able to offer a bit of help. However, one of the key goals of BYU-Pathway is to increase self-reliance and self-confidence. Too much well-meaning help can create dependency and helplessness that are directly in conflict with developing the student as a confident problem solver.

When help is given, it should be in the form of questions that help the student discover as much as possible on their own a path to a solution by themselves. This approach to instructing, rather than more traditional forms of lecturing, can teach much more important lessons, with a more lasting impact on the student's future.
