## Find A Student's Tuition Payment And Balance

If you find that the information displayed in the student's Finance tab differs from what is expected, consider the following:
- Ask the student to share their screen in a Zoom call to check the Finance tab in their portal. Sometimes the information in the student's portal is simpler and easier to understand, which can clarify discrepancies shown in the Finance tab of the student information in PATH.

- You can also request a district or zone leader to impersonate the student's portal to verify the information against the details in the Finance tab.
