## Byu-Pathway Worldwide Story

### Prophetic Statements

Our story begins 50 years ago when Henry B. Eyring is inaugurated as the president of Ricks College (now BYU-Idaho).

> "We must also find ways for this college to serve young people whose needs are shaped by a great variety of cultures and situations, and who may not be able to come to this campus … We will find direct ways to move the blessings of education … from this campus out into the lives of men and women everywhere."
>
> **Henry B. Eyring, "Inaugural Response," Rick College 1971**

Nearly 30 years later in 1998, David A. Bednar makes similar comments in his inaugural address as president of Ricks College.

> "It will be necessary for us ... to serve ever better the thousands of students we have on campus while simultaneously reaching out to bless the lives of tens of thousands of young Latter-day Saints throughout the world."
>
> **David A. Bednar, "Inaugural Response," 1998**

> "Zion is everywhere the Lord has established His Church. It is a miracle that we can say today that BYU-Pathway is a school in Zion, wherever Zion is."
>
> **Elder Kim B. Clark, Emeritus General Authority Seventy**

## A New Opportunity

BYU-Pathway has small beginnings. From gatherings in Arizona, Idaho, and New York through two international sites in Mexico and Ghana. We currently operate in all 50 states in the U.S. and in 180+ countries.

In 2009, the fulfillment of Henry B. Eyring and David A. Bednar's words come to pass when BYU-Idaho launches Pathway (also called Pathwayconnect).

A one-year, reduced-cost, online program offered to students wherever they live, with no need to ever come to a university campus.

Students meet for the first-ever Pathwayconnect gatherings on September 10, 2009, in Nampa, Idaho.

# Byu-Pathway Worldwide Mission

## Building Zion

Mirroring the pattern found in the temple, BYU-Pathway seeks to bring the Holy Ghost into students' lives so they can become disciple leaders and contribute to building Zion.

BYU-Pathway provides higher education to the "hidden many," or those who have not traditionally had access to education, wherever the Church is organized.

## Students:

- gain an education and grow in knowledge and truth
- use all they've learned and experienced to serve as disciple leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities.

BYU-Pathway seeks to provide education as an essential part of Heavenly Father's loving plan — and the way out of poverty.

"And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them." Moses 7:18

"Having no poor among us begins with each individual developing the skills to be spiritually and temporally self-reliant. As we become self-reliant, we can bless others, including future generations."

> "BYU-Pathway is one of the resources the Lord has prepared for His great gathering ahead of His return to the earth. One of the ways this will happen is by helping students all across the Church deepen their discipleship so they can in turn build others and build the Church."
>
> *Elder Clark G. Gilbert, Commissioner Of The Church Educational System*
