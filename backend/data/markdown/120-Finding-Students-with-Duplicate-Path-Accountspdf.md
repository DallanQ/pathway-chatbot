# Finding Students With Duplicate Path Accounts Path For Pathwayconnect

## Understanding Member Record Numbers (MRNs)

Each member of the Church has an MRN associated with their Church account and record.

MRNs are generated only by ward clerks when a person is blessed or baptized.

If a Church member has created two or more churchofjesuschrist.org accounts, only one of them will have their MRN. All other accounts will be considered as Friends of the Church accounts with no MRN.

## Overview Of Path Student Accounts

Students are required to use their Church username and password using the Church's sign-in page when applying to BYU-Pathway.

The PATH system checks for a Member Record Number (MRN) once a student has signed in. PATH records the ward and stake from the student's Church record if it finds one.

If there is no MRN, PATH considers the student a Friend of the Church (not a member) and the student is charged a 25% higher tuition rate.

## Where The Problem Occurs

1. A potential student goes to the Church sign-in page.

2. This person doesn't remember their church username or password, nor do they have any of the other information requested when they use the I forgot my username or password link.

3. They create a new church account with a new username and password resulting in another church account.

4. Sometimes students forget the account they used to begin the application, so they create still another church account. They fill out the application again and get another Church account.

## WHY STUDENTS WITH MULTIPLE PATH ACCOUNTS NEED TO ONLY HAVE AND USE ONE

### One Account Avoids:

- submitting assignments across multiple accounts
- course credits not being accounted for properly

### Tuition Charges For Each Account

- matriculation problems (BYU-I or Ensign unable to match records or the GPA for the account they are analyzing)
- multiple Church accounts and issues with other church systems

## Signs That A Student May Have Multiple Path Accounts

- Details Page: Is LDS indicates Yes but no ward or stake listed
- Details Page: Any student without ward or stake could still have multiple accounts
- Student is not able to log in to their student portal

# Student does not see grades posted to their account

- Two students in same gathering with very similar names, same age, birthdate, and address
- Student says they have taken one or more Pathwayconnect course, but nothing shows in their records tab.

## Best Time To Get The Problem Resolved

- Prior to PC 101 Term Start (or at bare minimum by Week 2)
- Every gathering missionary should check each student in their gathering for signs of duplication
- Duplicate accounts should be dealt with as soon as possible

Check each student in your Gathering by clicking on their name to go to their DETAILS page.

There are several items to look for once in the student's details page.

In this case, the fact that Is LDS indicates Yes but there is no Stake or Ward listed could be an indication that this student has multiple accounts.

A student may still have multiple PATH accounts if Is LDS is blank or indicates No and there is no stake or ward listed.

Student profile information may help confirm duplicate accounts: Preferred Name, Age, Cell Phone, Email 1, Email 2, Address 1 or 2, DOB, and Gender.

Make a note of the Church Account and the Student ID.

## How To Find If A Student Has Multiple Accounts

A student may say they have account issues. You might suspect a student has multiple accounts. Ask the student if they have more than one churchofjesuschrist.org account. If so, get the account username for each account if the student knows.

## Use Path Search To:

- Search street address of student (best option)
- Search email address (could be different)
- Search phone number (could be different or formatted differently)
- Search name variations or search by last name or first name. (whichever is most unique)

# Nauvoo Illinois Stake Nauvoo Ward

Notice one account shows a stake and ward. The other does not.

The account showing a stake and ward is the account that has the MRN. This is the account the student should be using!

**parleyp**

Note the Church Account name on this account.

**Pparkerpratt**

Note the different Church Account name on the second account.

More information that will be helpful is at the bottom of each Detail page. Compare Last Login for each account.

## What To Do When You Have Discovered Multiple Accounts

- Explain the issue to the student and give them their student numbers
- Emphasize that they are to use only one account (The one with their MRN if they are a church member). NOTE: The MRN is attached if ward and stake are listed on Details Page.
- For Friends of the Church, tell them to choose only one login and use only that one for all interaction with BYU-Pathway.
- Have any student with more than one account, member or not, contact their peer mentor to get the multiple accounts resolved.
