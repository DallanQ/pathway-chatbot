5\.2 Gathering Calendar
=======================




---






Each semester during PathwayConnect, students typically gather for 14 weeks. Academic course gatherings are scheduled to follow the BYU\-Idaho [academic calendar](https://www.byupathway.org/byu-idaho-block-academic-calendar). Religion course (institute) gatherings in international locations also follow BYU\-Idaho’s academic calendar, while in the U.S. \& Canada they generally follow the local institute’s calendar — which often aligns with a local college or university rather than with BYU\-Idaho.


In these situations, the academic gathering calendar and the local institute’s calendar may not coincide. Missionaries and students in the U.S. \& Canada should be aware of this possibility and plan accordingly.
