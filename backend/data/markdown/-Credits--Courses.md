[6\.3\.1 Transfer Credit](#6-3-1-transfer-credit)
-------------------------------------------------




All students are required to complete the specific curriculum required during PathwayConnect regardless of their previous university experience or coursework. Credits obtained at other colleges or universities cannot be substituted for PathwayConnect courses but may count after PathwayConnect as transfer credit toward a college or university program. Grades earned from local institutes of religion receive pass/fail credit and may be [transferred](http://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/11-after-pathway/byu-i#credits) to another school within the Church Educational System (CES).
