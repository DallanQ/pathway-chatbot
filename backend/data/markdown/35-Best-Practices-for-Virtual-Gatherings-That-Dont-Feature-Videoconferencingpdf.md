# Best Practices For Virtual Gatherings That Don't Feature Videoconferencing

**20 March 2020**

If you meet virtually, but using a videoconferencing tool like Zoom is not available, your missionaries may still conduct a gathering using live texting with a tool such as Whatsapp. This will require adapting the gathering agenda. Follow the principles below to have a successful gathering.

## Prepare

1. **Practice.** Learn how to use the texting tool recommended by your missionaries. Try it out with your friends or family before the gathering.

2. **Get Contact Information.** Before the gathering, make sure that you have everyone's contact information so you know who you are talking to.

3. **Type in Advance.** If you are the lead student, have important text or visuals prepared in advance that you can paste into the chat. You can get much of this from the gathering agenda.

4. **Follow the Agenda.** Even if you are not the lead student, you should have a copy of the gathering agenda in front of you. Seeing it will help you follow the lesson better.

## Adapt

5. **Look for the Big Purposes.** Currently, gathering agendas have not been prepared for text-only gatherings. Don't try to replicate the same kind of experience you would have if you were meeting in person or via videoconference but do try to accomplish the major purposes listed at the top of each gathering agenda.

6. **Don't Try Small Groups.** It is too difficult to break up and then come back together again. For this reason, conduct all small group discussions with the whole group.

7. **Engage With Partners Outside the Gathering.** In cases where the agenda asks you to do something with just one partner like help each other on an assignment, the lead student can consider assigning partners to meet via text before or after the gathering. If they meet before, they can be asked to share what they learned during the gathering.

8. **Modify the Length of the Gathering.** You may need to modify the length of the gathering depending on how well it is working.

## Make It Meaningful

9. **Be Flexible.** It might feel awkward or strange to have a "meeting" via text. Know that the meeting may be unlike anything you have ever done, and that is alright. Do the best you can to be comfortable with the meeting format. Help each other feel at ease.

10. **Pray.** Although a group prayer or hymn is not possible, you can still invite individuals to **Pray On Their Own At The Beginning.**

11. **Invite Balanced Participation from All.** When the whole group is together, the lead student can invite two or three people at a time to type comments. This will keep everyone from typing at once and make the discussion easier to follow. Rotate who comments so everyone gets a chance to participate.

- Keep Time. If you are the lead student, use a timer. Give students time to read. Give them time to write. Let the class know when you are about to move on to something else.

- Use Complete Words. Avoid abbreviations in your texting so everyone understands.

- Be Present. Avoid doing other activities during a gathering. This includes working, cooking, exercising, or communicating with others outside the gathering. Imagine yourself physically in the same room as everyone else. What would you do to be attentive?

- Take It Home. Consider using the gathering agenda at home as a way to continue the conversation and have a face-to-face discussion with the people who live there. This can be a great way to reinforce the principles in the gathering and teach one another.
