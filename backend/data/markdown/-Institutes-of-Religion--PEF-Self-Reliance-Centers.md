1\.2 Institutes of Religion \& PEF/ Self\-Reliance Centers
==========================================================




---






A key element of PathwayConnect’s organizational structure in most locations is its partnership with [Seminaries and Institutes of Religion](https://si.lds.org/). And in several locations outside the U.S. \& Canada, implementation and expansion of PathwayConnect is done in collaboration with the Church’s Perpetual Education Fund (PEF)/[Self\-reliance centers](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/self-reliance).


Typically, distance education programs come with significant capital investment. PathwayConnect, however, utilizes already existing institute and other Church facilities for its weekly gatherings and for a portion of its curriculum. Combine that with donated time from missionaries assigned to BYU\-Pathway Worldwide, and the program can operate at a relatively low cost—further expanding available locations and opportunities for students.
