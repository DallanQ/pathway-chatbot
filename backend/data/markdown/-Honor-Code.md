9\.1 Honor Code
===============




---






PathwayConnect students do not complete an ecclesiastical endorsement as part of their participation in the program. Students are encouraged to live the [CES Honor Code](https://www.lds.org/church-education/honor-code?lang=eng) as a matter of principle and to prepare them if they choose to later continue to an [online degree program](https://www.byupathway.org/degrees) from BYU\-Idaho, supported by BYU\-Pathway, where they will be required to live the [BYU\-Idaho Honor Code](http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code). Additionally, principles of academic integrity are strictly enforced.

[9\.1\.1 Disruptive Behavior](#9-1-1-disruptive-behavior)
---------------------------------------------------------




Students who violate BYU\-Pathway Worldwide policy or procedures (including, but not limited to, behavioral misconduct, abuse of administrative processes, inappropriate classroom behavior, intimidation, threats, violence, or other inappropriate actions at a gathering), in public or online, may be required to leave the program or the gathering when their misconduct significantly and adversely impacts the program’s ability to perform its mission or disrupts the general environment BYU\-Pathway is striving to achieve.



In cases of disruption involving a student with disabilities, the disability will be duly considered, but minimum standards of conduct will be required. This policy will make a determination based upon an individual’s behavior rather than upon the individual’s status of having a disability.



When it is determined that an individual is involved in significant disruptive behavior, the student will receive an appropriate sanction, including but not limited to, counsel and education, warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal from PathwayConnect. Referral for criminal prosecution will be made when warranted.

Participants behaving in such way are subject to BYU\-Pathway disciplinary action including suspension and/or dismissal from PathwayConnect, as well as referral to law enforcement.

The policy against sexual misconduct extends to BYU\-Pathway employees, missionaries, and students. If any of these parties encounter sexual harassment or gender\-based discrimination, or if they need assistance or information related to allegations of sexual harassment, they should contact [BYU\-Pathway Support](https://www.byupathway.org/help/contact-us).

[9\.1\.4 Plagiarism](#9-1-4-plagiarism)
---------------------------------------




Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one’s own without providing proper attribution to the original author through quotation, reference, or footnote.



Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non\-deliberate, use of another’s words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. It is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance.



Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Examples include:



* **Direct plagiarism**: the verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source.
* **Paraphrased plagiarism**: the paraphrasing of ideas from another without attribution, causing a reader to mistake these ideas for the writer’s own.
* **Plagiarism mosaic**: the borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one’s own writing, without acknowledging the source.
* **Insufficient acknowledgment**: the partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source.
