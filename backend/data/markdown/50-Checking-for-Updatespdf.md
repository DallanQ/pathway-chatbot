# Checking For Updates Zoom

For security reasons, you should check for updates every few weeks.

1. Open the Zoom app on your computer and click on your initials or image in the top right of the Zoom window.

2. Select Check for Updates. Zoom will guide you on what to do if an update is needed.

Zoom will automatically update to a new minimum version every three months (the first weekend of February, May, August, and November). This change is designed to help ensure that Zoom users receive the latest Zoom features, as well as any privacy and security enhancements made to the platform. See Zoom support for details.
