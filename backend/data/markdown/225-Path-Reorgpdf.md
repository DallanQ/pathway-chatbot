# Restructuring Area Organization In Path Changing Sites And Locations

Changes to mimic Area organization

Organization of Sites and Locations in PATH can be changed without disruption. There are many reasons to change the structure in PATH:

- With reorganization of the Area, it may be less confusing to have PATH mirror the new Organization.

- Growth may cause the need to divide into smaller Districts and/or Zones within the area. Zone Leaders see their Zones more easily when PATH matches organization by having only those Districts (Locations) under their Zone (Site).

- Program or curriculum changes may cause a different organization in the Area that can be reflected in the PATH organization.

The following is a way to reorganize Sites and Locations in PATH without disrupting gatherings, having to perform mass moves, or having downtime for leadership accessibility.

## Preparation

### Steps To Prepare For Organization

1. Make a chart of your new organization
2. Look at the current Site/Location Directory. Make a copy
3. Change your Site/Location list to match your new org chart
4. Rename Sites and Locations in a uniform manner
5. Now you are ready to change your organization in PATH

## Plan

1. Make a chart of your new organization
- Be sure it shows the organization of Zones and Districts with leaders.
2. Look at the current Site/Location Directory. Make a copy
- Make a copy of your current PATH Site/Location List.
- You may want to take a screen shot or simply copy the list of Sites and Locations.

In our example, the Utah Area had 8 Zones. Zones 1-7 had face-to-face gatherings and Zone 8 had 7 virtual districts with 10-20 gatherings each.

Face-to-face districts were named according to location. The virtual ones according to meeting day/time.

With the decrease in face-to-face gatherings, it was decided it would be best to divide the Virtual districts among the seven geographic Zones.

It was also decided to name the Zones and Districts with the same convention. All names were also prefaced with the Area name. This proved to save a lot of time in transferring students and assigning missionaries.

# Plan

3. Change your Copied Site/Location list to match your new org chart "Sites" are in a bolded blue font. They are usually Zones in your organization. "Locations" are unbolded blue and under the Locations heading. They are usually Districts. It could be divided so the Sites are lead by AACMs, making the Locations Zones.

4. Rename Sites and Locations in a uniform manner Your naming convention can be either place names or numbers, but it is advantageous to preface all names with a short name common to all, such as the Area name.

5. Now you are ready to change your information in PATH

## Changing Information In Path

## Steps To Change Information In Path

2. Change or add locations to the new Sites
3. Check the Site/Location page frequently
4. Adjust leadership
5. Cleanup
6. Done!!

## Change

1. Create or rename your Sites.

A. Most of the time you can just rename existing sites. If you do need more Sites than you currently have, you can also repurpose Sites that have been "Z'd" out by renaming them.

B. Renaming is easily done by clicking on the bolded Site name. in this case, Zone 1.

C. Clicking takes you to this page. Click on [Edit]

## Change

1. Create or rename your Sites. The Edit Site appears and a box is now around the Site name. You may now edit the name as planned.

## Scroll Down To The Bottom Of The Page And Click Save.

Do this for all your sites.

Once all your sites are created, or renamed, your Site/Location Directory list may appear different since the sites will appear in Alphabetical order and the locations aren't matched with them yet.

# Edit Name Without The Z

Leadership can be edited by clicking on +New Leader to the right.

## Don't Add Locations At This Time.

Click Save when done

1. Create or rename your Sites. The process is much the same to rename a Z'd out Site as it is to open a new site. Clicking on the bolded title, then on [Edit] takes you to a page, where the name can be edited as usual. Depending on how they were Z'd out, leadership can be added or changed now or in the next step. Do not add locations as that will be done in the next step. Click Save.

## Change

Go to Creating a New Site if there are no extra or Z'd out Sites available.

Once all of your sites are created, the PATH Site/Location Directory list may appear different than your proposed list. All sites should now appear in alphabetical order, but only some may have locations under them.

2. Change or add locations to the new Sites
A. Most of the time you can just rename existing locations. If you do need more locations than you currently have, you can also rename ones that have been "Z'd" out at the bottom of your list.
B. Renaming is easily done by clicking on the unbolded blue location name, in this case, Utah Brigham City 18-30.
C. This takes you to the Location Details page. Click on the grey Utilities tab.
Click on [Edit] by the Zone name. This takes you to the Change Site screen with the list of all options in the Area.
Choose the site, click Select.
D. Use the first [Edit] link to move the location to the desired Site.
Click on [Edit] and then change the name in the pop-up box. Click Save.
E. Use the second [Edit] link to rename the Location.
Click on [Edit] to change the Primary Missionary if needed.
F. Use the third [Edit] link to update the primary missionary
Go to the tutorial Opening a New Location if there are no extra or Z'd out Locations available.

## Change

3. Check the Site/Location page frequently
To be sure Locations are moving to the correct site and their names are accurate, compare the way the list looks with the Proposed list you made. Make any needed changes.

## Change

4. Adjust leadership
Once all Locations are named correctly and in the correct Sites with the correct programs, you will want to check the leadership in each zone (Site) and location (District). Those listed as leadership in the Zone will

# Be Able to See All Gatherings and Districts within that Zone

## Change

4. **Adjust Leadership**
Those listed as lead missionaries in the missionary list in the Locations (Districts) will be able to see all the missionaries and gathering information in those districts. Lead Missionary assignments can be changed by clicking on their blue name link. If you have divided your Zones or Districts and/or made them smaller, be sure the Zone Leaders and Lead Missionaries are listed only in the districts they need to see. Having them in extra districts can be confusing as all will appear in their page after clicking on My Sites.

## Section Number

## Clean Up

- You may want to delete any locations not being used in the near future in your Site by clicking on the bold blue title (Site), click on [Edit], scroll down to Locations. You may then click on the red minus in the circle by the location names you wish to delete. Then click Save. See Closing a Location.

- If you are unable to delete a desired location, go into that location and be sure all gatherings are closed. See Closing/Deprecating a Group. Then try again.

- Then Hide or Inactivate the Programs in all inactive locations you may be waiting to open again.

## Clean Up

Just for fun you may want to transfer a student or assign a missionary as soon as possible to see how easy it now will be to find all your Sites and locations in the drop-down lists.
