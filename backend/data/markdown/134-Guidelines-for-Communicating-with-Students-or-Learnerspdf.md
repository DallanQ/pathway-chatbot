# Guidelines For Communication Byu-Pathway

## PART ONE

### General Guidelines

**Guidelines From The Church**

The way we communicate represents who we are as followers of Jesus Christ. We want people to feel at least one—and often several—of these attributes as they interact with Christ's Church. Messages that include these attributes help people feel God's love for them.

- Welcoming
- Honest and True
- Compassionate
- Hopeful
- Global
- Humble
- Straightforward

**Inspiring**

For more information see the Church Communication Guide

**Guidelines From The Church**

Our communications point to this idea: the Church helps all of God's children feel His love by following Jesus Christ.

We can better do that by using:

- Simple and Clear Vocabulary
- Scriptures and True Doctrine
- Conversational Tone
- Focused Message
- Clear Organization
- Style Guidelines

Comprehension may be influenced by sentence length, complexity, and word difficulty. For example, the average adult in the United States reads at about an eighth-grade level.

### Simple And Clear Vocabulary

**Ask Yourself:**

- Who is your audience?
- What is the reader's level of knowledge and experience?
- What is the reader's literacy level?

# What is the reader's age?

## Then:

- Write at the lowest level of formality and difficulty for the intended audience.
- Choose words that are familiar, precise, and concrete.
- Use short, simple sentences.
- Use clear action verbs.
- Eliminate unnecessary words.
