# Security Zoom

How can you use the security feature in Zoom?

You can use the security feature to quickly:
- Lock the meeting—Prevent additional participants from joining your meeting.
- Restrict participant activities—Prevent participants from sharing their screens, sending chat messages, renaming themselves, etc.
- Remove participants—Remove a participant who shouldn't be in your meeting. You may need to do this if an unexpected person joins your meeting.

## Click Security At The Bottom Of The Zoom Window.

A menu will open showing multiple security options.

Click Lock Meeting to block users from entering the Zoom room.

Uncheck any options under Allow participants to prevent anyone from sharing screens, chatting, etc.

Click Suspend Participant Activities to immediately turn off everyone's video and audio, stop screen sharing, and lock the meeting.

If an unexpected person joins your meeting, remove them by selecting More next to their name in the participant list and clicking on Remove.

> Note: When your meeting is locked, students who leave the gathering due to poor internet connection or any other reason will not be able to get back in unless you unlock the meeting.

It is recommended that you set up a communication channel through texting or Whatsapp so that your students can reenter the gathering if the meeting is locked.
