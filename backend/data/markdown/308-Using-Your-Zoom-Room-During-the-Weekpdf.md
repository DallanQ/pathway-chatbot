# Using Your Zoom Room During The Week Shepherding/Ministering

Your Zoom room can be used by you or your students at any time of any day whenever you are not using it for a gathering. Here are a few suggestions!

- You or your students can use your Zoom room during the week to:
- Practice the language and resolve language-related concerns.
- Tutor each other on subjects concerning their current courses.
- Work together on team assignments.
- Allow for lead students to prepare and become familiar with Zoom features.
- Assist students who have trouble with Zoom, Canvas, or their student portal by using the screen sharing feature.

To avoid overlap, establish a communication plan with your students about when and how to use your Zoom room. Help students know what days and times are available to them.
