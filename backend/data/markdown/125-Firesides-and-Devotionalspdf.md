# Firesides And Devotionals Increasing Awareness

## Increasing Awareness

Firesides and devotionals are an excellent way to reach a large group of people. Careful planning and preparation should go into the promotion and execution of these events.

- Work with local leaders to ensure the proper and consistent promotion of the event occurs through announcements, flyers, and electronic communication.
- Additional promotional resources available are posters and handouts.

## Stake Involvement

Presentations should be given with the stake's assistance. This will instill a sense of ownership and increase success.

- Use the overview presentation provided to maintain consistency.
- Practice the presentation. Include one or more current/former BYU-Pathway student(s) to share their experience â€” be sure they keep their story to under five minutes.

## Presenting

It is recommended to arrange arriving at the venue at least 30 minutes in advance to test the audio and visual aids.

- Most firesides or devotionals will be an hour in length. That should allow sufficient time to present, as well as hold a brief question and answer session.

## Questions And Follow Ups

You may receive very specific questions that require a detailed response. Suggest to the individual that you can visit with them after the meeting to review their question a little more thoroughly.

- Use the printable interest list to collect names of attendees to conduct follow-ups. This list is found on the Missionary Services website.

## Timing

Experience shows that firesides are effective for the first year or two of BYU-Pathway in an area. After that, their effectiveness and attendance diminish. Consider that as you think about a potential devotional.

- Some have success holding a social event (i.e. BYU-Pathway BBQ) with current and potential students. Events like this can be another effective way in bringing people to BYU-Pathway and creating awareness within a stake.
