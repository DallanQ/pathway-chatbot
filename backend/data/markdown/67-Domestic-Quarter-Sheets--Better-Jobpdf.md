# GET A BETTER JOB, BEFORE GRADUATING.

The preferred path to a degree supported by BYU-Pathway Worldwide begins with Pathwayconnect and is recommended for most students. It includes foundational academic and religion courses that help students see increased success.

After Pathwayconnect, students will earn three certificates on their way to a bachelor's degree from BYU-Idaho or Ensign College. Each marketable certificate takes one year or less to complete and can be used to get a better job faster.
