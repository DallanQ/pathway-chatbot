# Video Settings Zoom

**How do I start and stop my video?**

It is recommended that missionaries and students have their video turned on during the entire gathering.

There are cases where students may keep their video off. Students may need to turn off their video to participate in the gathering due to poor internet connection.

Click on the Start/Stop Video icon at the bottom left corner of your Zoom window to turn off or turn on your video.

When a participant has turned off their video, Zoom shows either the participant's name, the type of device they are using, or their profile image.

You can click the ^ icon next to the Start/Stop Video button to see more video options, such as:

- Selecting which camera to use if you have more than one connected
- Adding a video filter
- Accessing additional video settings

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If a student enters the gathering and his video is not showing, instruct the student to click the ^ next to the Stop Video button to see if the correct camera is selected. Selecting the student's appropriate webcam camera should fix their problem.
