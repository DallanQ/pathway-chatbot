**2\. Access Errors**


| **EnglishConnect Information** |
| --- |
| EnglishConnect 3  If your Zoom link isn’t working, contact your missionaries. You can look up your missionaries’ contact information in the [Portal Home](https://path.byupathway.org/portal/home) if you do not know it.    EnglishConnect 1 \& 2  If you forget where your group meets you should go back on QuickReg and try to find it. In person groups will show the location and time. If your group is virtual the facilitator will reach out and provide you information about how to attend. If you do not hear from the facilitator, then we is encouraged to register for a different group. |


 
**3\. Course Errors and Information**


| **EnglishConnect Information** |
| --- |
| EnglishConnect 3  You do not see the completed activities in the "my progress" tab:  If you have completed your activities but the activities are not showing up in “my progress” tab it may be because the activities were not passed. To show progress in your progress tab each function needs to earn a star. There are 4 activities and a level test within each function, and you need to get 75% or higher on each activity to pass. Once you have passed all 4 activities you take a level test. You will have 3 chances to pass this level test. When you pass the level test you earn a star, and the progress will appear in your “my progress” tab.   If you are unable to submit your writing practice:  If the writing practice button is gray and you are unable to submit your work, try opening the writing activity again and adding or removing a space at the beginning or the end. This will activate the submit button.    If you are unable to submit your speaking practice:  Speaking Practice: If the speaking practice button is gray and you are unable to submit your work you may have to record again. Another option, if you have another device available, is to play your recording and record it on the other device. Then you can play it back and re\-record it on the first device to submit it.    “Content Problem” message:  If you are trying to see your speaking activities and a “Content Problem” message shows up you may need to try opening EnglishConnect 3 in another browser. For example, if you usually use Chrome, try using Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc. If you are on an Android device, the best browser is the latest version of Chrome. If you are on an iOS device, the best browser is Safari.    Can’t complete level 5  There are only 4 levels for each skill. If you are trying to practice but it says there are 0/0 quizzes or it shows Level 5, congratulations! You have already completed all the levels available to you in that skill. Please continue working on the other skills. The other levels will help you improve your English. |
