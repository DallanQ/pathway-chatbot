# Pathwayconnect/Online Degree Admission Deadlines

## October 12, 2020

**Priority Deadline**
The priority deadline encourages students to apply early but does not change anything operationally in our systems.

- The priority deadlines for Pathwayconnect and Online Degree programs will remain unchanged, with the Pathwayconnect priority deadline being 20 days before the start of the semester (Tuesday, 3 weeks before the semester begins) and the Online Degree priority deadline being the first day of the month prior to the start of a semester.

**Final Application Deadline**
The final application deadline marks the last day an individual can submit an application without receiving an exception.

- The final application deadline for both the Pathwayconnect and Online Degree programs will be the business day prior to the start of the semester (Friday whenever the semester starts on a Monday).
- The final application deadline for both of the programs will be the same date each semester. The online degree application will be closed on this date, allowing students to only be admitted by exception.
- For Pathwayconnect, international locations will close enrollment, while domestic applications will remain open and be placed on standby.
- This date will coincide with the "registration" deadline in Path.

**Enrollment Cut-Off Date**
