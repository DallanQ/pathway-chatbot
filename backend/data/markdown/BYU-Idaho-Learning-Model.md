BYU\-Idaho Learning Model
=========================


The Learning Model is designed to help students become more involved in their learning through preparation, teaching others, and applying what they have learned.






3 Key Steps of the Learning Model
---------------------------------



Students are invited to come to each class prepared to learn by studying assigned readings, completing required homework, and participating in online discussions and pre\-class study groups. Through instructor\-led activities in class, you will teach other students what you've learned—honing and refining your own understanding in the process. Later, you'll internalize your learning through review, reflection, and application.
