1. On the Missionary Services website, go to the Gathering Resources dropdown menu and hover over your group's course. Select the correct gathering week.

2. Next, click Academic Course Preview.

- This is the same way students go through their weekly assignments.

## Benefits Of Course Previews

### Preparation Brings Blessings
The Lead Student will lead the discussion. Occasionally, a last-minute emergency may prevent their attendance. Reviewing the weekly lessons will help you be prepared to facilitate the gathering if needed.

You will also be better able to follow the gathering discussion and direct the students where they can get help. In addition, you will better understand the students' point of view and ways to help grow their learning and testimony.
