6\.2 Grading System \& GPA
==========================




---






Grades are determined by each instructor based on an evaluation of all assigned and completed coursework. Academic and religion courses taken through BYU\-Idaho count toward a student’s PathwayConnect GPA but do not affect their ultimate BYU\-Idaho GPA (if they choose to matriculate into a BYU\-Idaho program after PathwayConnect). Grades earned from local institutes of religion do not count toward a student’s GPA. GPA is calculated by taking total earned points divided by earned credits.
