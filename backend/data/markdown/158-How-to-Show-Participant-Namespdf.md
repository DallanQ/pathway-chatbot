# How To Show Participant Names Zoom

How can you see each participant's name during a meeting? By default, Zoom hides the participant names unless you hover over with your cursor. Consider the following steps to always display the participant names.

First, open the video settings by pressing on the ^ symbol next to the Stop/Start Video button.

## In The Menu, Click On Video Settings.

In the Video Settings window check the Always display participant name on their videos box.

Now you can always see the name of the participants on their video.
