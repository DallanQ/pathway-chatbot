# Looking Out For The Hidden Crisis Shepherding/Ministering

Any one of your students could be struggling at any point during the term. Sometimes it is the student you least expect. The following activity illustrates this point. Take a minute to look over the painting in the next slide and write down all the different things you see happening in this scene.

## Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, by Pieter Bruegel

Did you notice the beautiful view of the city, the shepherd resting peacefully, and the ships sailing to harbor? Did you also notice the person drowning just below the closest ship in the lower right-hand corner? Within this peaceful scene and oblivious to those in it, someone is in desperate need of help.

The Savior loves us individually and is deeply interested in the success of each student in your group. Students that appear to be doing well could be having a "hidden crisis," like the person in the painting. It might be a family issue or stress at work that influences students to think they cannot continue.

Use the data in PATH to ensure students are progressing in their academic coursework. Continue to engage with the students and ask how they are doing. Seek guidance from the Spirit as you actively minister.
