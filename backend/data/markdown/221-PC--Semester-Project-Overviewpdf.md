# Pc 102 Semester Project Overview

**NOTE:** The content below is instruction given to students in PC 102 Week 7 regarding the PC 102 Semester Project.

This week, you will begin a project that lasts until Week 13. You will work on this project with a small group of people from your gathering group. Now, before you start to groan about group work, let us explain why we're having you do this. BYU-Pathway Worldwide has interviewed employers all around the world, and they consistently report that they need employees who know how to collaborate and work in teams. This data is confirmed by almost every survey we've seen (go ahead, it's worth a google), where employers consistently rank teamwork and collaboration in their top five requested employee skills. The more experience that you have working in teams, especially online, the more valuable you'll be not just to employers but also to your family, the Church, and your community.

In fact, a recent Business Insider article stated that the majority of companies in 2018 listed soft skills (like being able to work effectively in teams) as one of their top criteria for potential employees ([5 Soft Skills Linkedin Says Are Most Likely to Get You Hired](Links to an external site.)). It's easy to see why â€” consider some of the following skills that are developed through group work:

- Delegation (giving assignments)
- Planning and time management
- Pooled knowledge and skills
- An ability to share different perspectives
- Project management
- Conflict management
- An ability to give and receive feedback
- Accountability
- Giving and receiving support
- An ability to learn from one another and also teach
- Grit
- Collaboration and teamwork
- Improved communication skills

## Semester Project Overview

Your project is to create a proposal for a business that sells a drink called lemonade. You'll work on individual parts of the plan each week, and then you'll put it all together in a Powerpoint presentation that you'll be making to the banker when you ask her for a loan.

Don't let the size of this project scare you. It's been divided up into very manageable tasks each week. You will work together on the assignments, but your first priority will be to learn how to deal with all the issues (good and bad) that happen when you have to produce something as a team. If you have a good attitude, this will be one of your best learning experiences.

Refer to the application activity this week for submission information. You will work as a team and submit your own copy individually. You already should have gotten into teams in your Week 6 gathering, so be sure to reach out to your team early so that you have enough time to work together.

## How It Works

The project is divided up into the individual parts of a business plan. You'll work as a team to produce parts of the plan. Each week will have the following important elements:

- **Week ## Prepare:** Semester Project. Here, you will get general instructions on that week's work.

- **Week ## Application Activity:** Semester Project. Here, you will submit your work. Even though you are working together, everyone must submit their own copy.

The Math Lessons of this course are integrated into the semester project and are therefore an important part of the experience. Hopefully, this will give you an opportunity to learn and apply the math together in a practical setting. Please

# Complete the Math Lesson each week before you start work on the project.
