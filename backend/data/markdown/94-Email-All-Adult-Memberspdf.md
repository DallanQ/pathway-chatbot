## Elements Of An Effective Email

The email may consist of information about BYU-Pathway and/or an upcoming webinar or event that encourages enrollment.

This method can be very successful in raising awareness when done properly.

Key Elements:
- Short prophetic quote about the importance of education.
- Explanation of BYU-Pathway with temporal and spiritual outcomes students achieve as they participate (this should be concise and not include every detail about BYU-Pathway).
- A quote from a student.
- An invitation to act (register for a webinar, attend a devotional, visit the BYU-Pathway website, etc.).

## Email Example

President Nelson recently said, "Education is very important. I consider it a religious responsibility. The glory of God is intelligence."

BYU-Pathway provides members and friends of the church an opportunity to pursue an education in a supportive, flexible, and affordable way. BYU-Pathway combines an online curriculum and weekly gatherings to build spiritual and academic confidence. Students receive support from their classmates and service missionaries as they work to achieve their career and educational goals.

One student said of her BYU-Pathway experience as she obtained her bachelor's degree, "As I took courses and attended academic and religious gatherings weekly, I realized that the most important part was the education I received about Jesus Christ. I had always had faith in Him, but my time at BYU-Pathway solidified my knowledge of the gospel. Including God in my studies increased my understanding and gave me perspective of what I could truly accomplish."

We invite you to learn more about BYU-Pathway by visiting byupathway.org to see if it is the right choice for you, a family member, or friend. To find out more, watch the Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults with President Nelson (1:27:21).
