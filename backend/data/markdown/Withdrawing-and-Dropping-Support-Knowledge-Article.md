**1\. Withdrawing and Dropping**


| **Information** |
| --- |
| Essentially withdrawing and dropping complete the same function – removing you from a class. The biggest difference between withdrawing and dropping is tuition refunds, and how it affects your transcript. * Dropping: You will receive a full tuition refund, and will not receive a “W” (which stands for withdraw on your transcript) * Withdrawing: You will receive a prorated tuition refund to no refund, and you will receive a “W” on your transcript   For more information about tuition see [sec 3](#Anchor 2) For more information about introductory certificate courses, GPA, and/or transcripts see: * [PC \- Transcripts](https://pathway-missionary.powerappsportals.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01367/en-us) (sec 2\) * [PC \- Completion Requirements, Matriculation, and GPA](https://pathway-missionary.powerappsportals.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01242/en-us) |
