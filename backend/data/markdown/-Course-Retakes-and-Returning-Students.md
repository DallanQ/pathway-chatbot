3\.4 Course Retakes and Returning Students
==========================================




---






**Retakes** occur when individuals repeat PathwayConnect courses — either academic or religion — that have been previously completed. A retaken course replaces the credit and grade of the same previously completed course if the grade of the course retaken is higher. The highest grade of all the retakes is calculated into the PathwayConnect GPA and earned credits. Previous courses remain on the transcript and are designated as retake courses, but are not calculated into the GPA.



There is no limit to the amount of times a student can retake a PathwayConnect course. Additionally, credits earned in any PathwayConnect course, no matter how long ago the credit was earned, are still valid, and can be used to place returning students appropriately back into the program. This includes credit from institute and religion courses. Students who transfer to another school other than BYU\-Idaho must recognize that a transfer institution may not accept the retake course per this definition.



A **returning student**is a student who goes one or more semesters without taking a PathwayConnect course, thus delaying completion of the PathwayConnect program.



For the purposes of this section, both standard courses and their L versions may be listed together like this: “PC 101/L” where “L” refers to the L version.

* PC 101/L is equivalent to GSPC 120/L
* Students who need to complete semesters 2 or 3 from the old program will begin in semester 2 of the new program.
* To complete PathwayConnect, any student needs to have taken three religion or institute courses during PathwayConnect.

[3\.4\.2 Online\-Only Course Retake Eligibility](#3-4-2-online-only-course-retake-eligibility)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




PathwayConnect students are eligible to register for an online\-only retake version of a course (if available; does not apply to institute courses) if they:



a) earned a passing grade in the traditional gathering version of the course, and



b) gathered with their PathwayConnect group for the entire semester they were enrolled.



Students desiring to take the online\-only version of a course due to relocation or any other reason need to petition through the [BYU\-Pathway Support Center](https://www.byupathway.org/help/contact-us). These situations are decided on a case\-by\-case basis.



Online\-only retake courses and gathering courses may not be taken concurrently.
