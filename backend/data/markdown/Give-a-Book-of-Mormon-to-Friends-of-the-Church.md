**The Book of Mormon offers hope, strengthens faith in Jesus Christ, and allows the Spirit to give people peace and guidance in all aspects of their lives.** President RussellÂ M. Nelson taught that when we share the Book of Mormon, we share âthe *power* to heal, comfort, restore, succor, strengthen, console, and cheer our souls.â He promised that âas you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon *every day*, you will make better decisionsâ*every day*. â¦ As you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life.â


â\[The Book of Mormon] teaches the doctrine of Christ. â¦ \[It] provides the fullest and most authoritative understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be found anywhere. â¦ The full power of the gospel of Jesus Christ is contained in the Book of Mormonâ (â[The Book of Mormon: What Would Your Life Be Like without It?](/study/general-conference/2017/10/the-book-of-mormon-what-would-your-life-be-like-without-it?lang=eng),â Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 62â63\).


**There are many ways you can share the Book of Mormon with others.** You can tell people about a teaching you learned from it. You can share a verse with friends that relates to their lives. You can explain how the book has helped you discover the hope and healing that Jesus Christ offers and tag @thebookofmormon when you share online.


Invite someone to watch a Book of Mormon video or read an illustrated Book of Mormon story. Send someone the Book of Mormon app in their native language and show how it answers questions of the soul. Engage with the Churchâs Book of Mormon social media pages, or join communities focused on learning and sharing insights from the Book of Mormon.


As you pray for guidance on how to share the teachings and power of the Book of Mormon with others, the Holy Ghost will guide you.
