However, a high school diploma or equivalent is required in order to apply for [federal financial aid](http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid) (applies to U.S. students only).

[10\.1\.5 Previous Credits from Other Colleges](#10-1-5-previous-credits-from-other-colleges)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Applicants must submit all transcripts from previous colleges in the United States as part of the application to BYU\-Idaho [(see 10\.1\.7 PathwayConnect Credits to BYU\-Idaho](https://www.byupathway.org/revised-student-handbook/10-1-online-certificates-and-degrees-r#10-1-7-pathwayconnect-credits-to-byu-idaho) and [10\.1\.8 Institute Credits to BYU\-Idaho)](http://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/10-after-pathway/byu-i/#institute). For additional information about transfer credits, applicants may visit [www.byui.edu/transfer\-evaluation](http://www.byui.edu/transfer-evaluation).



Applicants for the BYU\-Idaho online degree program are not required to submit college transcripts from a foreign institution unless they want their credit evaluated for transferability.



Applicants for the BYU\-Idaho on\-campus program are required to submit college transcripts from foreign institutions.








---




[10\.1\.6 International Credits](#10-1-6-international-credits)
---------------------------------------------------------------




Students who have international transcripts and would like to have them evaluated must do so through the International Education Research Foundation (IERF) at [www.ierf.org](http://www.ierf.org/). Students send their transcripts to IERF, which then translates and evaluates the transcripts and sends them to BYU\-Idaho. Students should request a “Detail Report.” Students may add the evaluated transcripts to their records at a later date.



Due to the cost involved, it is also important for students to know that unlike domestic transcripts, international classes that do not have a direct BYU\-Idaho equivalency are not accepted as elective credit.








---




[10\.1\.7 PathwayConnect Credits to BYU\-Idaho](#10-1-7-pathwayconnect-credits-to-byu-idaho)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




All PathwayConnect course credits as indicated on an official PathwayConnect transcript will be counted as transfer credit to BYU\-Idaho. PC 101, PC 101L, PC 102, PC 102L, PC 103, PC 103L, and Institute Book of Mormon transfer as elective credit; while RELPC 121C, RELPC 122C, RELPC 250C, RELPC 200C, AND RELPC 275C transfer as religion credit. Institute credits must be transferred to BYU\-Idaho by each local institute. In order for an institute course to count as credit\-bearing, it must be taken for credit.



Credits obtained from other colleges may be transferable to BYU\-Idaho. However, official transfer credit evaluation does not occur until after a student is admitted to BYU\-Idaho. Students interested in seeing how their previous course credits may transfer to BYU\-Idaho can use the university’s [transfer credit tool](https://my.byui.edu/ICS/Transfer_Students).








---




[10\.1\.8 Institute Credits to BYU\-Idaho](#10-1-8-institute-credits-to-byu-idaho)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Institute courses taken “for credit” that a) have a letter grade (A through C\-) or pass (P) grade and b) have a direct equivalent to a BYU\-Idaho religion course will be accepted as transfer credit to fulfill BYU\-Idaho graduation requirements, but institute courses do not impact the student’s BYU\-Idaho GPA.



BYU\-Idaho considers evaluation of transferrable institute course credits only with an official institute of religion transcript. Official transcripts can be submitted via email or through the postal service.



### By Email


Official transcripts must come directly from an ldschurch.org email address of an institute instructor, secretary, or coordinator. Students may not submit transcripts. Emailed official transcripts should be sent to [transcriptsubmit@byui.edu](mailto:transcriptsubmit@byui.edu) after final grades have posted. The emailed transcript should be in the CES Transcript format, not the Institute Report Card format. A separate transcript for each student is required. (Note: Other schools in the Church Education System currently do not accept institute transcripts via email.)



### By Mail


Official transcripts must be signed by an institute coordinator or an authorized representative and submitted in a sealed envelope. BYU\-Idaho will not evaluate transcripts submitted via fax or any other method deemed unsecure by the university. Multiple transcripts from the same institute can be sent in the same envelope. Transcripts only need to be submitted once to BYU\-Idaho.



To ensure timely processing, mailed official transcripts should be sent to the BYU\-Idaho [Admissions Office](http://www.byui.edu/admissions) immediately after final grades are posted. Typical processing time is 2–6 weeks from the time the transcript is received to appearance on the student’s BYU\-Idaho transcript. Transcripts should be sent to Brigham Young University\-Idaho, Admissions Office, 120 Kimball Building, Rexburg, ID 83460\-1615\.



Institute courses will not appear on a student’s unofficial BYU\-Idaho transcript unless the student requests that the institute send the transcript to BYU\-Idaho Admissions. This is done after the student completes PathwayConnect.



Any questions regarding the process of sending official transcripts to BYU\-Idaho can be emailed to [transfer@byui.edu](mailto:transfer@byui.edu).
