# Sacrament Meeting Talks Increasing Awareness

## Speaking In Sacrament Meeting

### Focus Of The Meeting Is The Sacrament

Periodically, you will have an opportunity to speak in a sacrament meeting. You will naturally want to speak about the benefits of BYU-Pathway.

The church handbook states: "focus of the meeting is on the sacrament and building faith in Jesus Christ" (Church handbook 29.2.1.1).

### Focus Thoughts

Please consider the sacred nature of sacrament meeting and focus your thoughts on the doctrines and principles related to education and life-long learning, along with the blessings of BYU-Pathway.

### Avoid Details Of The Program Such As:

- cost
- degrees offerings
- matriculation
- etc.

### Personal Preparation

We invite you to seek the guidance of the Spirit and prayerfully select personal experiences and carefully chosen quotes or scriptures that might strengthen your message.
