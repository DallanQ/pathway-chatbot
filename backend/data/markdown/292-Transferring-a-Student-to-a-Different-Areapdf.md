# Transferring a Student to a Different Area PATH for Pathwayconnect

## Transferring Across Areas

### Working with ACMs

Suppose you are the Utah ACM and you have a student who needs to transfer from a Utah gathering to a New York gathering. The first step is to provide the North America Northeast ACM with the student's ID number and the time needed for the new gathering. (You can find ACM contact information and search gathering times using the ACM and Groups Lookup tool.)

The North America Northeast ACM will then use the student ID and gathering time to complete the transfer. Please consider two important items when transferring a student to another area:

- Always allow the ACM of the area where the student is transferring to make the transfer in PATH. Never transfer a student directly to another area.
- Students in the United States and Canada are not able to transfer to international gatherings.

Go to the Student Information page and click on the Enrollment tab.

## Instruction for the ACM bringing the student into their area

1. Select the student's current location and program.
2. Click Transfer Location.

An error message will appear. It is a bug in the system. Click OK to continue.

3. Select the new location. Then, click Save.

The student will now appear in the Unassigned List in the new area and location.
