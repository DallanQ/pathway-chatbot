# Policy â€“ Issuing Zoom Licenses
Date: October 24, 2022

The only individuals in BYU-Pathway Worldwide who may be issued a Zoom Account are BYU- Pathway full-time employees, part-time employees, church service or full-time missionaries facilitating virtual Pathwayconnect and Englishconnect 3 gatherings; along with BYU-Pathway church service missionaries with a leadership role (such as District or Zone leader). If an individual does not meet these qualifications, a BYU-Pathway Zoom Account will not be issued.

Typically, one Zoom Account will be issued per married missionary couple. For other companionships (e.g. elder and elder) both missionaries may receive a Zoom account so they can support students. The Missionary Services team will default to using the Elder's email address when ordering a Zoom Account for a married couple unless instructed otherwise.

The process for ordering Zoom Accounts for new and currently serving missionaries is as follows:

## A. New Missionary

1. ACM fills out a Missionary Information Form for the new missionary
2. The Orientation Team orders a Zoom Account using the Zoom Account Request Form by entering the missionary's assigned location and the preferred email address. The Orientation Team provide virtual training to the missionary.
3. The Orientation Team notifies the ACM that training is complete.

## B. Currently Serving Missionary

1. For a currently serving missionary who will begin working with a virtual group, the ACM or Area Manager emails Missionary Support requesting them to change the missionary's current role to a virtual Pathwayconnect or Englishconnect 3 assignment and to add the new assignment to their information in the Missionary Information Tracker.
2. The Orientation team is notified by the change in the Missionary Information Tracker and contacts the missionary.
3. The Orientation Team orders a Zoom Account using the Zoom Account Request Form by entering the missionary's assigned location and the preferred email address. The Orientation Team provide virtual training to the missionary.
4. The Orientation Team notifies the ACM that training is complete.
