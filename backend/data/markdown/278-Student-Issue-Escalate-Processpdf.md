# Student Issue Escalation Process Shepherding

## How You Can Help

You often get student questions regarding enrollment, finance, applications, and matriculation because of your close relationship. This article will help you know the process for student support issues and what you can do if a student is not receiving the help they need.

### Student Issue Escalation Process

1. Recommend the student to first work with their mentor to resolve any issues regarding enrollment, finance, applications, or matriculation.

2. A student should submit the Mentor Concern Form if he or she is not receiving the help needed. Submissions to this form will help mentors improve their training.

3. A student without an assigned mentor can schedule a time with an enrollment counselor. Scheduling can be done through the chatbot in the student portal.

4. A student not receiving the help needed by an enrollment counselor should submit their concern through the Enrollment Counselor Concern Form.

5. Contact your zone or district leader if the student issue has not been resolved in two business days. Your zone or district leader will consult with your ACM for further escalation.

## Addition Tips

It is important to describe the student case in detail to your zone or district leader. This is critical when troubleshooting a technical error. Screenshots when possible are recommended.

- Submitting the concern forms will help the Student Success team improve the needed training for mentors and enrollment counselors.
