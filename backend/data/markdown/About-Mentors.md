The power of your peers
-----------------------

Nobody knows the BYU\-Pathway experience better than our current students. They can empathize with your situation, provide you with guidance to become successful, and help you find and use resources you didn’t even know existed.

Each of our nearly 500 mentors are united in their belief that as followers of Jesus Christ we are meant to support one another and encourage each other’s success, **creating a stronger community and network**. 




Your mentor is...
-----------------

A **resource** throughout your educational journey. They will help guide students by offering strategies for success, important reminders, support resources, and encouragement.






> I almost dropped out of school this year. But after a conversation with my mentor, I changed my mind. They are someone who is by your side to support you and cheer for your success.

Common Questions
----------------






What is a mentor?
BYU\-Pathway mentors are a resource to students throughout their educational journey, offering strategies for success, important reminders, connecting students to support resources, and providing encouragement to help students achieve their goals. Mentors are BYU\-Pathway students themselves, which helps them share a deep understanding of the student experience.  






What can my mentor help with?
Mentors are trained to guide you through your educational journey. They will regularly reach out to offer strategies for success, provide important reminders, connect you to support resources, and give you encouragement to help you achieve each milestone on the way to graduation.  
  
For specific questions about course assignments, please contact your instructor. For questions about your gathering, reach out to your [service missionaries](https://www.byupathway.edu/service-missionaries). For advising, technical issues, and other concerns, contact [support](https://www.byupathway.edu/student-support).  
  






Do all students have mentors?
**Enrolled students**  
Every enrolled BYU\-Pathway student is assigned a mentor, including students actively participating in PathwayConnect and online degree programs from BYU\-Idaho and Ensign College, serviced by BYU\-Pathway.  
  
**Not\-enrolled students**  
Students who have never enrolled or who were previously enrolled in courses will not have an assigned mentor yet. These students should contact [BYU\-Pathway Support](https://www.byupathway.edu/student-support) for help.





How do I contact my assigned mentor?
You can find the name and contact information of your assigned mentor in three easy steps:  
1. Sign into the [Companion App](https://companion.byupathway.org/)
2. Click "My Network"
3. Choose the "My Mentor" option to connect with your Mentor

At the beginning of each term, mentors will also introduce themselves to their assigned students. You can share your preferred contact method with your mentor for future communication.





What if my mentor doesn’t respond?
Please give your mentor 24 hours to respond to your question. If you do not hear back, log in to your BYU\-Pathway Portal and submit a concern using the “Mentor Problem?” card under “Resources.”







> I encourage you to use and talk to your mentor because they are eager to help. I promise you their one goal is to help you succeed.
