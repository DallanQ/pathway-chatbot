9\.2 Procedures for Handling Misconduct
=======================================




---






Misconduct that occurs outside of a PathwayConnect course (such as in a PathwayConnect gathering or among PathwayConnect students and/or missionaries) should be reported to [BYU\-Pathway Support](https://byupathway.org/help). Misconduct that occurs within a PathwayConnect course is generally handled by instructors, but may also be reported to Pathway Support [(see 9\.2\.1 Misconduct in a PathwayConnect Course)](https://www.byupathway.org/revised-student-handbook/9-2-procedures-for-handling-misconduct-r).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Instructors are responsible to establish and communicate to students their expectations of behavior with respect to academic honesty and conduct in the course. Instructors are responsible to investigate any incident of academic dishonesty or misconduct, determine the circumstances, and take appropriate action. Examples of appropriate action include but are not limited to the following:



* Reprimanding the student orally or in writing
* Requiring the student to redo work affected by the academic dishonesty
* Administering a lower or failing grade on the affected assignment, test, or course


Violations of the Academic Honesty Policy should be reported to [BYU\-Pathway Support](https://byupathway.org/help) detailing the studentâ€™s name, the incident, and any action taken. If the occurrence is sufficiently egregious, or if a pattern of dishonesty or misconduct is discovered, BYU\-Pathway Worldwide may take additional action, based upon the nature of the violation.


If a student disagrees with the determination or action and is unable to resolve the matter to the mutual satisfaction of the student and the instructor, he or she may file a grievance with [BYU\-Pathway Support](https://byupathway.org/help).
