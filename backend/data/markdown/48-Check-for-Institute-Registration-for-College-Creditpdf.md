## WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?

- Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, And Zone Leaders, And ACMS

## PURPOSE:

This article discusses methods for finding Institute enrollment information in PATH and the student portal. Currently, there is no good way to see if the current course for a student is for college credit. The best method is to have the student ask their Institute instructor.

## Checking For Institute Registration For College Credit

### All Students Should Be Enrolled In An Institute Course

It is important that a student's institute course is for college credit. Students are given choices from among the four Cornerstone Courses required for a degree at a church university when they enroll in Institute (part of their initial application and enrollment in Pathwayconnect).

These courses are:
- Jesus Christ and the Everlasting Gospel
- Teachings and Doctrines of the Book of Mormon
- The Eternal Family
- Foundations of the Restoration of the Restoration

## Additional Institute courses are needed for an associate or bachelor's degree from BYU-Idaho University or Ensign College. After completing the four cornerstone courses, students will be able to choose from a list of approved electives at each institution. You cannot see if the course qualifies for college credit until the course is complete, even though you can see if a student is currently enrolled in an institute class in PATH. Encourage your students to confirm with their Institute instructor that their enrolled course will qualify as college credit at a CES institution.

Institute courses may not be available to select until a later date for those who sign up early for the next term of Pathwayconnect.

1. Click on a student in your group list.
2. Next, click on the Enrollment tab and scroll down.
3. Focus on the gray box to the right as you scroll.
4. You will see Institute courses taken by the student as you scroll. This student has taken many Institute courses but has not taken them for college credit. The student is currently enrolled in a Spring 2024 course but shows a x NO because the course is not yet completed. Once the course is completed, the x No will change to a green check mark with a Yes if the course qualifies for credit.
5. This student is enrolled in an institute course for Spring 2024. It is not one of the cornerstone classes. The Student should ask the instructor if this course will provide college credit. If so, the No will change to Yes at the completion of the course. The previous 2023 course taken by this student has been given college credit

# Students Registration Process
