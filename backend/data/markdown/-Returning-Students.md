2\.5 Returning Students
=======================




---






Students who do not complete one or more semesters of PathwayConnect and later decide to rejoin PathwayConnect will need to reapply for admission. These students will not lose any previous course credits earned through PathwayConnect, but they will need to follow the [same application process](https://www.byupathway.org/revised-student-handbook/2-1-application-process-re) as brand\-new students in order to re\-enter the program.


Students who complete one or more semesters of PathwayConnect and later decide to rejoin PathwayConnect do not need to reapply. Students in this situation should contact [BYU\-Pathway Support](https://www.byupathway.org/help/contact-us) for additional information and details.
