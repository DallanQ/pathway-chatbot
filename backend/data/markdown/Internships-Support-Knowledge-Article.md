2\. Internship Approval


| (BYU\-Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| Internship courses require approval before you can register for them. It is your responsibility to gain approval before registering for an internship course. You will NOT be able to add an internship course to your schedule without the proper authorization.    To submit an Internship Approval request, you will need to: 1. Find an internship. 2. Complete the Internship Approval Form on I\-Plan.  Once you have been given approval for your internship, you will need to make sure your Internship course is planned in the semester you received approval for. If the course is not populating in the approved semester or in your Degree Planner at all, you will need to contact an Academic Advisor.    If you are unable to register for the Internship Course before Registration ends BUT have been approved for your Internship, you can still be registered for the Internship course. Please contact an Academic Advisor.     This ONLY applies to Internships, NOT Projects. You will need to contact the department chair for help with this. You can find contact information on the [BYU\-Idaho Internships](https://www.byui.edu/internships/) website. |
