# Guidelines for Virtual Gatherings

## Learn The System

- **Practice:** Learn how to use the breakout rooms, share screen, chat, and other features in Zoom.
- Ask family and friends to practice with you. Experience with these features will prepare you for the gathering.

- **Connect:** Learn how to connect to your gathering Zoom room so you can arrive on time. Test out your camera and microphone before your first gathering. Identify someone who can help you if you have trouble with the technology.

- **Re-connect:** Be prepared to communicate to your gathering missionaries if your connection stops and you cannot return to the gathering. Start the gathering if you think your missionaries cannot join due to internet issues.

## Be Present

- **Be On Time:** Please be on time. Being late to a virtual gathering is the same as being late to an in-person gathering.

- **Be Attentive:** Avoid doing other activities during a gathering. This includes working, cooking, exercising, or talking with others around you. Imagine being in the same room with your gathering group. What would you do to be attentive? Help the lead learner by being attentive to what they are teaching.

- **Be Seen:** Have your camera on at all times. Keep your camera on if you have to leave for a moment. Others will know when you return. It is okay to turn your camera off if you have a poor or slow internet connection.

## Strive For Audio And Video Quality

- **Stabilize:** Secure your camera so it does not move around during the gathering.

- **Use a Headset:** Use a headset or earbuds with a microphone if possible. Others will hear you better, and it will reduce background noise.

- **Reduce Noise:** Mute your microphone whenever you are not speaking.

- **Control Lighting:** Be sure the group can clearly see your face. Avoid bright lights behind you such as windows or lamps.
