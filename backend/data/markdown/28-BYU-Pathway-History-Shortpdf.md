## July 1971 - Elder Henry B. Eyring's Vision

In July 1971, Henry B. Eyring was named the tenth president of Ricks College. Elder Eyring recalled a profound moment where he felt the need to preserve the unique spirit of the college. He emphasized the importance of finding ways to extend education beyond the campus to reach individuals worldwide.

## Elder Eyring's Committee and Vision

During his presidency, Elder Eyring led a committee to explore the future of higher education within the Church Educational System. The committee aimed to expand the reach and impact of post-secondary education by incorporating faith-based learning in various settings such as CES campuses, institute campuses, chapels, and homes.

## July 1, 1997 - Elder David A. Bednar's Initiatives

Elder David A. Bednar assumed the presidency of the college in 1997. He directed efforts towards making education more accessible and affordable to a broader student population. This period saw a shift towards innovative teaching methods, including online education for a diverse student body.

## Elder Eyring's Insight and Influence

Elder Eyring, now the Commissioner of Church Education, and Elder Bednar reflected on the disparity between the few who benefitted from educational facilities and the larger Church membership. This realization inspired Elder Bednar to challenge the faculty to envision serving 50,000 students globally, marking a significant shift in perspective.

## 2005 - Elder Kim B. Clark's Leadership

In 2005, Elder Kim B. Clark assumed the role of President of the college, which had been renamed BYU-Idaho by President Gordon B. Hinckley. Elder Clark continued the vision set forth by Elder Eyring, focusing on the university's potential to cater to a global audience.

One notable change implemented by Elder Clark was the introduction of a learning model emphasizing the role of the Spirit in education. This model promoted active learning, where teachers facilitated student engagement in the learning process. The model's three key elements, still utilized in BYU-Pathway Worldwide instruction, are: prepare, teach one another, and.

# Pondering and Proving in Education

Students prepare before attending class to deepen the classroom discussion, leading to subsequent pondering that deepens understanding of the material. In this model, active learning is essential to the desired outcome of learning by faith and increasing the quality of education.

## Vision for Enhanced Learning

In his first speech at BYU-Idaho, Elder Clark emphasized leveraging information technology to enhance the learning experience and connect students beyond physical barriers. The goal was to create interactive educational experiences where students teach each other in innovative ways. The vision extended to developing technologies and methods applicable not only locally but also globally, aiming to bless the youth of the Church worldwide.

## Evolution of Online Education

Elder Clark invited Clark Gilbert, now President of BYU-Pathway Worldwide, to BYU-Idaho. Gilbert, a former Harvard Business School faculty member, proposed expanding education beyond campus boundaries. This led to the creation of the Pathwayconnect program, approved swiftly by the Church Education Executive Committee.

The initiative aimed to extend online education to individuals unprepared for traditional college, with the potential to serve more students efficiently. Clark Gilbert was appointed by Elder Eyring to lead this online education endeavor.

## Focus on Quality and Collaboration

BYU-Pathway's online efforts were designed not to replace traditional higher education but to enhance and preserve the campus experience for remote learners. The Pathwayconnect courses were cohort-based, emphasizing student collaboration and interaction over independent study models.

Online courses, taught by full-time faculty, were continuously evaluated for meeting course objectives, with improvements based on assessments. BYU-Idaho initiated the online program in 2008, utilizing various online tools like forums, discussion boards, podcasts, and wikis.

## Importance of Gathering and Learning Together

During a visit to BYU-Idaho, Elder David A. Bednar highlighted the significance of gathering within the Pathwayconnect experience. He emphasized the spiritual benefits of coming together to learn, prepare for responsibilities, strengthen relationships, and gain insights into the purpose of existence.

BYU-Pathway Worldwide's Pathwayconnect program upholds the value of gathering, with cohorts meeting weekly to instruct and learn collectively, complementing the online coursework. The online courses, requiring 9 to 12 hours of work per week, are facilitated by an online instructor, fostering dialogue and engagement among students.

# Various Topics with Other BYU-Pathway Students

This weekly gathering is a necessary element of the online course. At each gathering, Pathway missionaries host the meeting, but the mid-week teaching is done by BYU-Pathway students. BYU-Idaho instructors instruct class content, then at gatherings, lead students engage their classmates in discussions and learning activities that deepen learning, create a safe learning environment, and invite the Spirit. Students help each other accept and embrace responsibility for their own learning.

BYU-Pathway Worldwide's growth continues to accelerate and will probably continue to do so for years to come. The words revealed long ago to the Prophet Joseph Smith to teach of things both in heaven and in earth, and to seek learning by study and also by faith are now becoming a genuine reality for many worldwide Church members — and those not of our faith — as BYU- Pathway Worldwide assists them in finding their own academic path. This organization seems destined to flourish. As it continues along its inspired course, it will change untold lives. As a result, families will be fortified, faith will flourish, and a people will be prepared.
