## Block

### Time is a Challenge

Many of our students are full-time workers, care for families, carry out church callings, and endure temporal challenges (like unannounced blackouts or slow internet), all factors that limit the amount of weekly time they can spend studying and completing course work. These time limits slow the amount of time it takes for a student to achieve a certificate and ultimately a degree.

### A Slow Path

The average credit load per semester for domestic Pathwayconnect students is approximately six credits, with approximately one third of them taking three or fewer. At the six-credit pace, with no breaks, it will take a student 1.7 years to complete the first certificate, and 7.7 years to complete a bachelor's degree. This is a slow pace.

### A Quicker Way

BYU-Pathway Worldwide would like to help students attain their academic goals faster so they can enjoy the benefits of higher education sooner rather than later. When students take block courses, their pace accelerates while still attaining the same outcomes. Should they continue taking six credits per term (block term), they can finish a first certificate in 1 year, and a bachelor's degree in 4 years. Getting to academic milestones faster helps students find employment gains faster, and it reinforces their hard work in school, which can lead to increased motivation to persist until graduation.

### Block in Pathwayconnect

BYU-Pathway Worldwide has begun converting courses to the block schedule, with PC 101 and PC 102 now tested and going to selected student populations in a gradual rollout. PC 103, and the certificate course taken concurrently, remain on the semester schedule for the time being. This will reduce Pathwayconnect completion time from three to two semesters. During those two semesters, all Pathwayconnect students will take a semester-length Institute course regardless of their age.

### Dates and Deadlines

Block terms in Pathwayconnect will come with their own sets of dates and deadlines. This is consistent with universities like BYU-Idaho and Ensign College. Students taking block courses will follow the block dates and deadlines. The visual below illustrates these sets of dates and deadlines. Click here to see the current sets of dates and deadlines.

## Instructional Teams

*"Instructional Teams"* is a new kind of instructional model with multiple benefits. In this model, two professionals team up to serve the student: the Team Instructor, and the Team Grader. This model has been tested over the last several semesters and has produced very favorable results for students.

### The Team Instructor

The team instructor's role involves several elements, each focused on helping students succeed in the course. From a logistics side, they shepherd students through the online course to help them know its structure and meet its expectations. Along the way, they inspire, lift, and motivate students to continue along the path. Team instructors also identify gradebook and other trends impeding academic success and conduct targeted outreach to provide instruction to impacted groups and individuals. Their role within the context of the course is focused on building capable learners who are confident in their

## The Team Grader

The team grader's role is to provide students accurate grades and feedback so students know how they are performing and where they can improve. Team graders follow strict policies and procedures while using scoring rubrics and feedback templates to give timely grades and robust feedback on manually graded assignments. They are not assigned to a section of students but instead grade each assignment from the entire pool of students on a first-come basis. This flexibility greatly speeds up the time it takes for students to receive grades and feedback. Should students have a question or concern about their grade on a given assignment, they work with the team grader to clarify scores and feedback as needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Block Curriculum

- When will block PC 101 and 102 begin?
- All new domestic students (Plus Pacific) will use the block PC 101 and PC 102 starting Winter 2022. International areas will begin in a gradual rollout between Spring 2022 and Spring 2023.

- Can I see a block course?
- The preview courses can be found [here](link).

- What about students that started on the semester schedule?
- These students will continue the semester schedule. Once they matriculate, they can find and enroll in block courses then.

- When will we see a block PC 103?
- There are several issues yet to be resolved before a block PC 103 could be proposed to the executives for approval. However, a limited pilot is scheduled for Spring 2022 to discover more about how to resolve these issues.

### Communication

- How will block students receive messaging?
- Email messaging and messages sent through the BYU-Pathway Portal are coordinated around students who pertain to a block PATH program (track). These messages are tailored to the block experience, especially when explaining dates and deadlines.

### Enrollment

- How many starts per year will there be with block?
- Pathwayconnect will continue to start new students at the beginning of Winter, Spring, or Fall semesters. PC 101 will only be taught on Block 1, and PC 102 on Block 2 of each of those semesters. This means that area managers continue to start cohorts in the same three time slots per year. Even though block 2 terms are visible in PATH to potentially set up new cohorts in Block 2, please do not do this.

- Which PATH program is used for block?
- Click [here](link) to find the appropriate list of PATH program(s) for a given semester in your area.

- What about returning students?
- Returning students will follow the same process they currently do, whether they took semester-length PC 101 or PC 102, or they took older courses such as GS 120. PATH understands the equivalency and prerequisite relationship between older courses and these new block ones and will route students appropriately to the right course. If they need to just take PC 102, they will only be placed into PC 102 for the second block.

- What if a student withdraws?
- Students who withdraw will need to wait for another semester to reapply. As noted above, there are still three starts per year.

# Finances

Will students need to pay tuition for PC 101 block before they can move to PC 102?

Yes. Because PC 101 is on the block schedule, students will need to pay tuition before the beginning of PC 102 on the second block.

# Missionary

How are gathering groups affected?

PC 101 or PC 102 block students should not gather with semester students. There are separate gathering agendas for the block courses. Related gathering materials can be found on the Missionary Services Website [here](#).

Do gathering groups need to be quarantined?

Yes. The gathering agendas for block are different than the regular versions. Students in block should not be in the same gathering as students in the regular version.

Where is the training for missionaries?

Missionary training documents will be modified in time for those who are shepherding block students. Missionaries may ask further questions through their leadership channels.

# Instructional Teams

Are graders and instructors assigned to the same gathering group(s)?

No. In the traditional arrangement, instructors were not assigned to the same gathering group. This will continue with instructors and graders.

How are graders and instructors assigned to students?

Graders work with the pool of all students. They grade each submission from the pool in the order it is submitted. As part of the feedback for each graded assignment, graders give students a link that students can use to contact the grader and discuss the score and/or feedback if desired. Instructors are still assigned to a section of students in Canvas. Instructors work with that same section of students during the entire term.

What are the roles for those who regularly work with students?

There are at least four roles that support students on a regular basis, and their major duties are illustrated below. It is important to note that if a student expresses a concern about an assignment grade or feedback, that they use the link found in their assignment feedback to clarify with the grader. If they have concerns with the course in general, they should reach out to their instructor. People filling these roles should direct students to the right person, repeatedly as needed, to help students know which role fills which set of needs.

## Instructors

- Operate with the same people in a section
- Shepherd students through the course as a whole
- Conduct targeted outreach and provide additional instruction to those academically at-risk

## Missionaries

- Operate with the same people in a gathering group
- Shepherd students through Pathwayconnect
- Encourage students to contact instructor or grader as needed

## Student

## Graders

- Use a queue to grade the next submission in line (multiple people across multiple sections)
- Engage with students at the assignment level only
- Handle grading/feedback clarifications at the assignment level

# Mentors

- Operate with a selected group of people from an area
- Empower students to overcome obstacles through increased self-reliance so they will persist
- Help students connect with appropriate resources
