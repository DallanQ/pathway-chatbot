# Support Options For Students

## WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?
Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, Zone Leaders, ACMs, and Students

## PURPOSE:
Missionaries should instruct students to follow these steps when they need help. In an effort to improve the student experience, new support options are now available, with more to come! Future and current students use different resources, so please carefully review the information below to know how to best direct them when they have questions.

## Resources For Future Students
- New Support Web Page
- Visit byupathway.edu/student-support to see the new BYU-Pathway Support page, which focuses on connecting future students with enrollment counselors.
- Website chat bot
- The chat bot on byupathway.edu is intended to help future students learn more about BYU-Pathway and enroll.

## Resources for Continuing Students
- Student portal chat bot
- The "Need Help" chat bot in the student portal is uniquely designed for current students. They can get answers to common questions, ask a new question, and manage their support tickets.
- Submit a ticket in the portal
- Students can use the "Support" link at the top of their portal (with their BYU-Pathway ID) to submit a ticket.
- Companion app
- The new Companion app allows students to receive push notifications and access the chat bot without logging in to their portal. Plus, it can respond in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French! Students can visit companion.byupathway.org, go to "More," and select "How to Download the App" to get started.
- Support Network
- In addition to service missionaries and instructors, mentors help guide students through their educational journey by offering strategies for success, important reminders, support resources, and encouragement.
