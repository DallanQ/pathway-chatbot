# Purpose
This training is designed to help gathering missionaries and students invite their friends who are not members of the Church to join Pathwayconnect. This training should not exceed 30 minutes.

## Read BYU-Pathway
BYU-Pathway is one of the best missionary tools in the Church. Currently, the number of students not of our faith in Pathwayconnect is over 1000. A majority of these students join Pathwayconnect because of its spiritual component. Recent surveys show that when students not of our faith are asked to learn about the gospel, that over 90% accept the invitation. Roughly 30% of those students are baptized. Think about the impact if more of our friends and friends of our students were invited to join Pathwayconnect. This training will discuss how the Spirit will guide you when inviting and ideas for starting a conversation.

## Read The Spirit will guide our words when we invite (D&C 33:8-10).

> 9 Yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo, I am with you.
>
> 10 Yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled, saying: Repent, repent, and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
