Learn how to find your educational path when you aren’t sure which degree to choose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------















Getting a degree is hard work, but sometimes choosing what to study can be the hardest part! The options can be overwhelming, and you might not know where to begin, but you can find a degree that works for you as you seek to understand yourself and align your life with your end goals.

Understand yourself
-------------------

What do you enjoy? What are you good at? What would you like to achieve in your life? To find the answers to these questions, you might try taking a few career\-interest tests and even a few personality tests to help you understand your interests and what areas of work you would do well in.














Self\-reflection can guide you to the degree that works for you.






The 
 
 [16 personalities test](https://www.16personalities.com/)
 
 , for example, can give you insights about your likes, relationships, and work environments you might enjoy. 
 
 [Typefocus](https://v6.typefocus.com/)
 
 is great to help you explore different career options (current access codes are available through 
 
 [BYU\-I](https://www.byui.edu/student-guide/self-discovery)
 
 ).

As you begin to narrow down a few options, consider reaching out to professionals in your area(s) of interest. Ask them what they love about their job and things they find challenging. You might even see if you can shadow them for a day to see what a typical day of work looks like for them.

Begin with the end in mind
--------------------------

As you gain a better understanding of yourself, create a plan of what you ultimately want to accomplish and determine how higher education can help you fulfill that plan. It might help to start with your bigger goals and then break them into smaller ones.

1\) **Look at the bigger picture**. What are your long\-term goals and your core values? Think of the things that are most important to you.














A degree at BYU\-Pathway is a degree you can depend on!






2\) **Brainstorm careers that will help you reach those goals**. As you look into jobs that will help you accomplish your purpose, you can then look at degrees that can lead you to that path and also be marketable among employers. During Elder Clark G. Gilbert’s inaugural address, he described BYU\-Idaho online degree programs, presented and coordinated by BYU\-Pathway, in this way:

Degrees at BYU\-Pathway Worldwide are designed to be highly employable, in high demand among students, stackable from a certificate to a degree, and consistent.

This means, no matter what degree you choose to pursue, you can be confident you’re setting yourself up for success.

3\) **Look at ways BYU\-Pathway can help you achieve your long\-term goals**. When you begin to connect your life plans to the things you do frequently, like school work, discussion boards, or other projects, you will find more joy as you seek to earn your degree. Ask yourself frequently, “What can I do today to make my goals a reality tomorrow?”

The degree for me
-----------------

There are many different degrees you can choose from, but finding what works for you can help you narrow down the options. As you seek to align your life goals with the goals of your education, you can move forward with confidence knowing that Heavenly Father trusts you and will support you. If you happen to choose a path that isn’t right, don’t worry. As you act in faith, God will let you know before you go too far. Be confident in yourself and continue on the path to reach your dreams.














A degree is possible, and you can discover your educational path.
