# Auto-Drop Pathwayconnect

## Auto-Drop

Non-participating students will be dropped from Pathwayconnect on Tuesday of Week 3. Students cannot re-enroll for the current term but can apply for future terms.

Non-participation is defined as not submitting any assignments during Weeks 1 or 2.

**What is auto-drop?**

Auto-drop is the process to determine whether to unenroll a student who is not participating in their course. This is intended to help. These students are not likely to withdraw themselves and may earn a failing grade on their transcript and a tuition charge, unless they are unenrolled.

## Evaluation Window

An evaluation window is the timeframe when BYU-Pathway looks at student activity to decide if they are participating or not. Students are considered as non-participating and are auto-dropped if they do not turn in any graded quizzes or assignments during the evaluation window.

## What Happens After Auto-Drop?

- Auto-dropped students will not receive a grade or a 'W' on their transcript.
- Auto-dropped students will receive a full refund. If a student has not paid, the charges will be excused for that term.

## How can you help?

### Helping Students Continue

- Encourage students to log in to their Canvas course before courses begin. They should contact their mentor if they cannot log in. Solving log in issues early will help students start their coursework on time.
- Contact students who don't log in to Canvas in the first week of the term. Encourage them to submit their assignment for the week. Refer to the PATH article Monitoring Student Progress for help.
- Follow-up with students who haven't logged in to Canvas at the beginning of the second week. Encourage them to submit their assignments. Discuss what obstacles may be in the student's way. What can they do to overcome these early challenges?
