### Impersonate A Learner

**WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?**
Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, and Zone Leaders

**PURPOSE**
This article will give missionaries information on impersonating in the Learner Platform and the Learner Portal

### LEARNER PLATFORM
When you impersonate on the Englishconnect 3 Platform, the data they see is yours, not a learner's.

Access the EC3 Platform by navigating to ec3.Englishconnect.org.

### LEARNER PORTAL
Gathering missionaries cannot impersonate the learner to see the learner's portal. EC3 specialists or district/zone Leaders will need to impersonate for gathering missionaries.

For more information search Learner Portal on Missionary Services to see an example of a learner's portal.
