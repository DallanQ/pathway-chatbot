If the bishop is unavailable to do the interview, one of his counselors can perform it. If that is not an option, the applicant can contact the stake presidency and have two members from the stake presidency do the interview.   Students with an incomplete Endorsements will expire after 90 days.

**3\. Non\-Member Endorsements**

| Non\-members are welcome to participate in the Online Degrees program. They must receive an application endorsement, as well as annual endorsements.  Those Endorsements are obtained through their own Ecclesiastical Leader or a local LDS leader, as well as the University Chaplain. The Chaplain will contact the student for their Endorsement interview. If the student has questions about how long it will take, advise them that it will be taken care of as soon as possible. BYUI has asked specifically that we not put a time frame on how long it takes the chaplain to reach out.  It is a wide range based on demand.  If a student is concerned, we can check with BYU\-Idaho on a case\-by\-case basis. **Advise the student that the Chaplain may have already attempted to contact them via phone or email. Please ask them to check their SPAM or Junk email folders to ensure that they have not missed this communication.**If the student is a non\-member, they will need to choose one of the following options for acquiring an ecclesiastical endorsement:* During the “Start Endorsement” section, review endorsement instructions. 	+ Indicate if you want to interview with your own religious leader or if you will interview with a bishop/branch president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\-day Saints. 	+ Indicate that you have read and understood. * Click “Begin My Endorsement”. * Interview with own religious leader 	+ If you selected that you want to meet with your own religious leader, a window will pop\-up with instructions for completing the endorsement.
