The purpose of the New Learner Visit is to help each learner:

- Create a relationship with the missionaries
- Understand how they will be supported during the course

## How To Visit In Person

Consider adding learners to a text, Facebook, or Whatsapp group as soon as you have contact information and permission from the learner to add them.

### Welcome Friends of the Church

- Ask if they have a friend in the gathering or know someone who is a member of the Church.
- The gatherings have religious studies and discussions.
- Learners are not expected to join the Church, but all learners must maintain a respectful attitude toward the doctrines, beliefs, and standards of others.

# Prayer Guidelines

- **Prayer is part of the gathering.** Learners may pray in their own way, or we can show how members of the Church pray. If learners are uncomfortable praying, they may decline to do so.

- **English Language:** We will learn English Prayer language. **ENGLISHCONNECT 3 IS OWNED BY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS**. There may be terms and ideas that are unfamiliar to some learners. Please come to us missionaries with any questions.

- **Assistance Offered:**
- We can help you understand our core beliefs.
- We can help you find and become familiar with The Gospel Library.
- We can provide you with a physical copy of the Book of Mormon.

- **Closure:** Close with testimony and offer a prayer

## Pre-Semester Gathering

Consider meeting as a group if time does not allow for individual visits before the semester start date. You may need to host several meetings to ensure all can attend. Adapt the suggested outline in the previous slides for your meeting. Save personal introductions for the individual visits.

## In Person

- Meet in your gathering location (church or institute building)
- Schedule your same gathering day and time if possible
- Consider using a group messaging tool if travel is a concern

## Virtual

- Meet in your gathering Zoom room
- Schedule your same gathering day and time if possible
- Consider using a group messaging tool if data is a concern

## Follow-Up Personal Meeting

After your Pre-Semester Gathering, continue to schedule personal New Learner Visits, even if the semester has begun. It is very important to build a relationship with each learner so that they feel cared for and supported. This is especially important for less active learners and friends of the Church.
