# Pc 103 Block Pilot Spring 2022

**Note:** This document is not intended to be shared with students, although information from it can be used to assist participating students with questions about the pilot.

**Last Updated 23 March 2022**

## Overview

In Spring 2022, Pathwayconnect will pilot a block version of PC 103 during block 1, which runs from April 18 – June 4. Pilot participants will continue to take their certificate and institute/religion courses on the semester schedule, which runs from April 18 – July 23.

The following FAQs are provided to help you understand the implications of this pilot. If you have more questions, you may send them to James Findlay jfindlay@byupathway.org.

## Who will participate?

- All students moving to PC 103 in the following Church areas
- Pacific
- North America Northeast
- North America Southeast

- This will include domestic students who started Fall 2021 on Semester as well as Winter 2022 on Block.
- The total number of participants will be approximately 600.

## What Are The Pilot Research Questions?

- To what extent are the key performance indicators the same or different between the block courses and their semester versions, including the following:
- GPA
- Throughput
- Course rating
- Hours per credit per week
- Perceived learning
- Instructor Rating

- To what extent does having a 7-week PC 103 held in block 1 impact matriculation rates?
- To what extent does having a 7-week PC 103 held in block 1 impact the end of Pathwayconnect program evaluation metrics?

## How will sections be filled?

Sections will be filled manually between April 11-25. Please let James Findlay know if you hear of anyone transferring into or out of your Church area during this time span. We will no longer be able to move students into or out of pilot sections after April 25.

## How will pilot participants pay?

Students will pay for both PC 103 and their gateway course the same way they currently do in the third semester, using the same semester term dates and deadlines.

## What happens if students withdraw?

When students withdraw, they withdraw from the entire program and thus all their courses. They are invited to re-enroll in an upcoming semester.

## How will students gather?

Students will continue to gather with their cohorts. After seven weeks, when block 2 starts, PC 103 will be over and therefore no longer require a PC 103 gathering attendance report. However, students are encouraged to continue gathering as a 103 group. Students will continue to do their institute or religion gathering though week 14.

# What will happen to a student that needs to transfer to a different gathering group after the April 25th deadline?

Their section will remain the same, but their gathering group will likely be different.

If they are transferring from a pilot group to another pilot group, this poses no problem. If they are transferring out of a pilot group, to a non-pilot group, then they will be gathering with a group that is doing PC 103 on the semester while they remain in PC 103 block. They will need to be aware of that difference. Let James Findlay know so he can notify the instructor.

Likewise, if a student transfers from a non-pilot group to a pilot group after April 25, their Canvas course will be PC 103 semester while their new 103 gathering group will be on the block. Again, let James Findlay know in such instances so he can notify the instructor. It would be best if students don't transfer in or out of a pilot gathering group, but it is OK if they move if they know the implications.

## How will students matriculate in PC 103 block?

One of the research questions stated above asks how a seven-week PC 103 will be able to support students as they complete the application for matriculation. Completing the application is one of the outcomes of the course. Due to the shortened nature of the block schedule, additional elements have been placed in the block course to bolster its messaging and encouragement around the application. These elements include more urgency in the language, and specific encouragement to complete the "Start Endorsement" section of the application, a known stall point.

## How will students be supported?

Personnel who support students (e.g., missionaries, mentors, instructors, Pathway Support agents) will be notified of the pilot and which areas are participating. This FAQ document can inform any relevant training and knowledge base articles. Training from James Findlay is available upon request by leadership jfindlay@byupathway.org.

In addition, the instructional teams model is always bundled with block courses. In the instructional teams model, specially trained graders handle the grading while instructors focus on facilitating the course and building student confidence to succeed in it. They also shepherd students through the course by performing regular analyses of student achievement, noting trends, and conducting targeted outreach to groups and individuals.
