# Area Coordination Missionary Vetting Recommendation Instructions

This recommendation process can be used by area managers to measure the basic skill set, attitude, available time, and interest of potential Service Missionaries' willingness to serve as an Area Coordination Missionary (ACM) for BYU-Pathway Worldwide. Specific needs, abilities, and access in areas around the globe will vary, which will necessitate adjustments to this recommended process as directed by the area manager. The intent of this vetting recommendation tool is to facilitate a conversation with a potential missionary to increase understanding of the service needs, opportunities, and gain a better understanding of the missionary's ability to serve as an ACM. For the best possible outcome, it is recommended that new ACMs be identified from missionaries already serving with BYU-Pathway who have experience facilitating weekly gatherings and who have served as a lead missionary and/or missionary zone leader. This document may be shared with the potential ACM for further pondering.
