# Byu-Pathway Worldwide Is For Any Student

BYU-Pathway Worldwide can be a wonderful opportunity for any student, but especially for those who want the flexibility of an online education, want to build academic confidence, or need more time to figure out their next move.

BYU-Pathway helps individuals who want or need more flexibility or who want to explore something other than a traditional campus experience.

Visit byupathway.org or contact service missionaries assigned to BYU-Pathway to learn more.
