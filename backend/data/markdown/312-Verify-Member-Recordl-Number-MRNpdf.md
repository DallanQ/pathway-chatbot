# Verify Member Record Number (Mrn) Path For Pathwayconnect

## Verifying Member Record Numbers

Why Verify a Student's Member Record Number Is Attached to Their Student Account?

- A student will get the member tuition rate for their country.
- A student will have linked their BYU-Pathway account with their Church records.
- The MRN attached to a BYU-Pathway account will automatically give the student a 25% Missionary Discount, for a missionary who has returned within the last five years.

## How You Identify That A Student'S Mrn Is Attached

- Their Ward and Stake will appear on their Details Tab in PATH.
- Their Ward and Stake will be shown within the group PDF.

You should verify for student in your group because mentors cannot see this information. You will be able to solve many issues early by helping correct this issue.

## A Member Record Number Can Be Verified In Two Places

- First, open a gathering group and then open the PDF toward the top right. If the student's ward and stake show in their student information on the PDF, then they have attached their BYU-Pathway account to their Church records. The entire group can quickly be checked.
- Second, by looking in the Details Tab for a student. The ward and stake will display above the gray box which shows their gathering information.

> If the ward and stake are blank, that would indicate a friend of the church and tuition would be 25% higher. If Is Member shows yes, but no ward or stake appear, it could indicate duplicate accounts, or an inaccurate response.

1. Go to a gathering group that shows the list of students.
2. Click the PDF to see a list of all students in the gathering.
- You will see their pertinent information, including their Ward and Stake.
