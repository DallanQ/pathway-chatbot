# How To Locate Stakes And Student Information

Finding Information in Path

When meeting with stake or local leaders, it is helpful to know about their Englishconnect or Pathwayconnect students. These students are often the best advertisement for the program. You can access this information before meeting with the leaders in PATH.

Leaders Can Find Information in the LCR

Leaders who have access to the Leader Clerk Resources can also find this information in the Reports dropdown menu. Those with access are ward and stake council members.

Log in to PATH and go to the search bar.
