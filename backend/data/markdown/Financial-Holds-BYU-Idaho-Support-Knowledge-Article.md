| Past debts must be paid in full in order to remove the Past Due Debts (PDD). You will not be able to register for the next semester or get transcripts or diploma. There is no exception to temporarily removing these holds. Once the account is paid off, this hold will come off automatically. |


 
**3\. PDU1**

| PDU1 is used if an account has been put into the hold file or sent to a collection agency. At this point, you can no longer see your balance in your portal.   If you have already paid your balance you will need to reach out to Accounting Services to remove the hold. Respond to the email Accounting Services sent you. |


 
**4\. PPMT – Pre\-Payment Hold**

| The PPMT \- Pre\-Payment hold is used if you have been sent to an outside collections agency and Accounting Services requires this hold for two semesters. You cannot pay using their Financial Aid awards from future semesters.  ***How to Prepay for the Semester***You have to prepay for the next semester before you can register again. You must prepay for the amount of credits you will be taking and cannot add more credits than the amount pre\-paid for. You can prepay by doing the following:  1\. Log into your student portal at [byupathway.edu](https://byupathway.edu) 2\. Click on Make a Payment 3\. Click on Make a Payment again on the next screen 4\. Choose the Hold Account, and then type in the amount that you need to pre\-pay 5\.

**5\. PNSF**


| Information |
| --- |
| The PNSF hold is used when a payment has bounced. If you have this hole it will prevent you from registering, transcripts, and receiving your diploma. To remove this hold, you will need to make the payment in full. If you pay with an e\-check, you will have to wait 10\-14 days until the payment clears for the hold to be removed. You also will need to fill out a failed payment petition here: [Failed Payment Petition](https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/75/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=709) |
