# Help The Lead Learner

## Englishconnect 3

### SELECTING A RETURNING LEARNER AS THE FIRST LEAD LEARNER

- If possible, choose a returning learner to be the first lead learner in Week 3.
- A returning learner needs less guidance, which frees you to minister to the other learners.
- This individual should still participate as the observing student in Week 2. They may observe best practices new to them.

### FIRST LEAD LEARNERS NEW TO EC3

- Begin talking about lead learners early if there are no returning learners. Consider explaining lead learners in a pre-semester gathering or in the New Learner Visit.
- Look for learners with strong English skills and who seem confident.
- Begin to sign up lead learners as soon as they will commit. You will have more time to provide support and encouragement.

### GENERAL GUIDELINES

- The Week 2 Lesson Plan Powerpoint (slides 22-26) contains good information about The Lead Learner.
- Meeting with observing learners and lead learners each week right after the gathering is a standard practice.
- The ideas to support the lead learner in slides 8-10 of the Week 2 Lesson Plan are applicable to all learners.
- The following content in this training shows a suggested timeline for helping new learners be successful lead learners.

### FIRST GATHERING, PRE-SEMESTER GATHERING, OR NEW STUDENT VISIT

- Explain the role of the lead learner to all learners. Create a sign-up list to select lead learners for the gatherings beginning with Week 3.
- Two learners may lead together.
- Pray about who to invite to be a lead learner.
- Not everyone is comfortable volunteering during the gathering. Be mindful of those who might need a private invitation.
- Sometime before the second gathering share the Observation and Feedback sheet with the Week 3 lead learner. They will be the observing student for the second gathering.

### THE SECOND GATHERING

- Meet briefly with the observing learner after the second gathering to discuss the Observation and Feedback sheet. Address these questions following your presentation.
- What I felt I did well.
- What I could have done better.
- What did I learn from this experience
- Schedule a time with the lead

# Learner Preparation for Third Gathering

- Select an observing learner for Week 3 and provide them with the Observation and Feedback sheet to prepare for the third gathering.

## The Lead Learner

### Third and Subsequent Gatherings

Meet briefly with the observing learner and the lead learner after the gathering to discuss the Observation and Feedback sheet. Celebrate what went well and allow the observing learner to give positive feedback. Consider asking the lead learner:
- What do you feel you did well?
- Where do you feel you could improve? (Discourage the learner from being overly critical of themselves.)
- What did you learn from the experience?
- What advice do you have for the next lead learner?

This meeting is a confidence-building experience and helps the observing learner prepare for when they lead.

### The Third Gathering and Beyond

Increase the lead learner's confidence by sharing examples of what was done well. Do not correct language or grammar. Set a time to meet with the observing learner to prepare for their leading the next gathering. Give the Observation and Feedback sheet to the observing student for the next week.

## Lead Learner Preparation

### Lesson Plans

Find the lesson plans and other gathering preparation material on the Missionary Services website in the Englishconnect 3 Missionary Guide. The lesson plan is the agenda or outline for the lesson. The presentation is a slide deck to use during the lesson. The preparation is for all students to read and write before the gathering.

- Lesson plan items include quotes, stories, scriptures, and discussion activities that relate to the week's learning.
- The lesson plan includes directions on how to divide learners into smaller groups for discussion or activities.

### Lead Learner Responsibilities

Encourage 95% participation/English practice in large and small groups.

# Follow The Lesson Plan

## Follow The Spirit

**WHERE YOU CAN HELP THE LEAD LEARNER**
- Help with any hard to pronounce words if asked.
- Explain parts of the lesson as needed.
- Run the Powerpoint presentation if asked.
- Teach the lead learner techniques to encourage participation.
- Encourage learners to read the Powerpoint slides to increase participation.
- Send a group list of learners to help the lead learner track who is participating.

## The Lead Learner

**IN PERSON GATHERING**
- Offer to set up chairs in rows, a circle, groups, or any preferred way requested by the lead learner.
- Set up the audio/visual equipment and assist the lead learner with connecting their laptop. You may use your laptop to run the Powerpoint for the lead learner if they request.

**VIRTUAL GATHERING**
- Help organize and manage the breakout rooms.
- Set the length of time for the breakout rooms and adjust the time if needed to be sure all activities are completed.
- Many learners do not come prepared with a copy of the questions or discussion items. Share resources to the breakout rooms during discussions. Consider using a second computer so that you can join breakout rooms.
