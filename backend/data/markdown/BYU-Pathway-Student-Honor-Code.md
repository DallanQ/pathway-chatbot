Student Honor Code
------------------

The [CES Honor Code](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church-education/honor-code) is a policy that students who have continued to an online\-degree program from BYU\-Idaho and Ensign College must follow. While you aren’t required to follow the Honor Code during PathwayConnect, we encourage you to become familiar with it now. The Honor Code includes these principles:  


* Maintain an Ecclesiastical Endorsement, including striving to deepen faith and maintain gospel standards.
* Be honest.
* Live a chaste and virtuous life, including abstaining from sexual relations outside marriage between a man and a woman. Living a chaste and virtuous life also includes abstaining from same\-sex romantic behavior.
* Abstain from alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, vaping, marijuana, and other substance abuse.
* Participate regularly in Church services.
* Respect others, including the avoidance of profane and vulgar language.
* Obey the law and follow campus policies, including the CES Dress and Grooming standards.
* Encourage others in their commitment to comply with the Honor Code and Dress and Grooming standards.

Every year, students attending an online\-degree program will be required to complete an ecclesiastical endorsement. This means you will meet with a local ecclesiastical leader and/or Chaplain, where they will ask you questions about your willingness to live by the Honor Code.

Disruptive Behavior

**General**  
Students who violate BYU\-Pathway Worldwide policies or procedures, in public or online, may be required to leave the program when their misconduct impacts the Institution’s ability to perform its mission or disrupts the educational process and environment.

**Disruptive Behavior**   
Disruptive behavior may include but is not limited to abuse of administrative processes, intimidation, threats, harassment, or other inappropriate behavior. Disruptive behavior may involve verbal or written statements, gestures, or expressions that communicate direct or indirect threats of emotional, sexual, or physical harm.

 Disruptive behavior may include conduct that challenges or expresses differences of opinion in a disrespectful, belligerent, or uncooperative manner.

 **Harassment, Hazing, Intimidation, or Aggressive Behavior**   
Harassment is any unwanted behavior, physical or verbal (or even suggested), that makes a reasonable person feel uncomfortable, humiliated, or mentally distressed. All forms of harassment (verbal, physical, mental, or sexual), hazing, intimidation, exploitation, or aggressive behavior that threatens or endangers the physical or emotional health and safety of others are prohibited.

Participants behaving in such a way may be subject to BYU\-Pathway disciplinary action including suspension and/or dismissal as well as referral to law enforcement.
