# Creating A New Group Path For Pathwayconnect

This task can only be performed by individuals in the following roles:

- Lead missionary
- District/zone leader
- Area coordination missionary
- Area manager

Lead missionaries should check with their area manager or area coordination missionary BEFORE performing this task to be sure that they are authorized to do so.

You will create groups before the beginning of each term based on projections from the enrollment of the same term in the previous year. See the training Checking Enrollment Trends.

Note: PATH will not allow you to set up a group without missionaries assigned to it. Add the Zone or District leader as the placeholder if you don't have missionaries assigned yet. Please replace the names with the missionaries' once they are identified.

Search for the location where the group will be added. Once you are in the correct location page, click the Groups tab.
