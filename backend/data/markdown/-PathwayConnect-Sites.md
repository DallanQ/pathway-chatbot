4\.1 PathwayConnect Sites
=========================




---






A PathwayConnect site is a specific geographic area that has been approved to offer PathwayConnect. Sites are typically comprised of two or more stakes and may contain multiple locations [(see 4\.2 PathwayConnect Groups)](https://www.byupathway.org/revised-student-handbook/4-2-pathwayconnect-groups-re).

[4\.1\.1 Program Expansion](#4-1-1-program-expansion)
-----------------------------------------------------




New PathwayConnect sites are typically requested by local priesthood leaders (Area President, Area Seventy, and/or stake president). All [site applications](https://www.byupathway.org/local-church-leaders) and requests go through an approval process involving some or all of the following: BYU\-Pathway Worldwide, the BYU\-Pathway Worldwide Presidentâ€™s Executive Group, and the Church Board of Education. Potential sites are strategically selected to serve the most members possible.

[4\.1\.2 Site Approval Guidelines](#4-1-2-site-approval-guidelines)
-------------------------------------------------------------------




For PathwayConnect to succeed, local priesthood leadership and support are critical. PathwayConnect works best as a regional, multi\-stake effort, where two or more stakes are actively participating. In areas where PathwayConnect has been most successful, priesthood leaders discuss the program openly in councils, trainings, and other church meetings. Clear communication and support is recommended at the Seventy, stake, and ward levels.


Priesthood leaders interested in applying for a local PathwayConnect site should counsel with a BYU\-Pathway area manager or director. Priesthood leaders interested in learning more about PathwayConnect, how it can assist them in their ministry, and how to ensure local program success can visit the [Local Leaders](https://www.byupathway.org/local-church-leaders) web page.
