2. **Awareness:**
- Learners become aware of what they don't know and see the need for the knowledge or skill.
- It's common to see a big drop in self-confidence at this stage.

> Missionary application: Explain that making mistakes is part of the learning process. Point out their progress.

3. **Learning:**
- Learners can do some things, but they worry about doing well enough; their confidence may remain low at this stage, even when their ability improves.
- Performing the skill requires concentration.

> Missionary application: Break the skill down into steps. Praise them on their effort and progress.

4. **Mastery:**
- Learners have high confidence and high ability.
- They can do the skill well without thinking about it; the skill is automatic.

> Missionary application: The individual can help teach others.

The overarching purpose of Heavenly Father's great plan of happiness is to provide His spirit children with opportunities to learn.
