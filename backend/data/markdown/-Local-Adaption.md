12\. Local Adaption
===================




---






PathwayConnect is established in locations with a wide variety of political, social, and economic conditions. These conditions may require BYU\-Pathway Worldwide to adapt the program in some areas. However, no adaptations may be made to established BYU\-Pathway policies and procedures without the written consent or direction of a BYU\-Pathway area manager or director.
