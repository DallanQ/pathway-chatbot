# International Area Transitioning To Block

## Overview
Pathwayconnect is transitioning international areas to "block" in a gradual rollout through Spring 2023. Transitioning to block means that all your new students will take PCIB 101 on the first block and then PCIB 102 on the second block. At this time, students will never take PCIB 101 on the second block, or PCIB 102 on the first block.

In the course code "PCIB 101," the "I" indicates that the students will be taught by an international instructor. All international students are now taught by international instructors. The "B" indicates that the course is taught on the block schedule. Blocks are seven weeks long.

When it is your turn to make this transition, please follow the steps below.

## Path Programs
1. Stop using the programs "International" and "International L" for new students.
2. Use only the program called "Block-Sem International 18+" for new students.

## Cohort Starts
3. You used to start students in the terms called Winter 20##, Spring 20##, and Fall 20##. That practice is now permanently over for you. You will now start students using these three terms:
a. Winter 20## Block 1
b. Spring 20## Block 1
c. Fall 20## Block 1

Please DO NOT set up a location to start new students in any of the block 2 terms. In short, there is nothing you need to do that involves setting up a location for block 2.

## Returning Students Needing PCB 102
Returning students needing PCIB 102 will follow the same process they always have. When they are reapplying, they will be given information about available gathering groups they can join. The system will also tell them when PCIB 102 starts, which will be the start date of a block 2 term. While we may advertise an earlier date, Path will allow students to complete registration to PCIB 102 up until Monday of Week 2 of a block 2 term.

## International Area Block Rollout Plan
