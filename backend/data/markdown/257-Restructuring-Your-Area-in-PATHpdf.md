# Restructuring Area Organization In Path Path For Pathwayconnect

Organization of sites and locations in PATH can be changed without disruption. There are several reasons to consider restructuring in PATH:

- It can be less confusing to have PATH mirror any changes in an area organization.
- Growth may necessitate dividing into smaller districts and/or zones within the area. Zone leaders can more easily oversee their zones when PATH aligns with the district (location) structure within the zone (site).
- Program or curriculum changes may require a different organization in the area, which can be reflected in the PATH organization.

## Changes to Mimic Area Organization

- Reorganization should be coordinated with your area manager.
- The following steps demonstrate a method to reorganize sites and locations in PATH without disrupting gatherings, mass moves, or causing downtime for leadership accessibility.

## Preparation

### Steps To Prepare For Organization

1. Make a chart of your new organization.
2. Examine the current Site/Location Directory (create a copy).
3. Adjust your Site/Location list to align with your new org chart.
4. Standardize the naming of sites and locations.
5. Implement the changes in PATH.

## Plan

1. Ensure your new organization chart illustrates the zones and districts with leaders. The sample organization provided has five zones.

2. Duplicate the current Site/Location Directory by capturing screenshots or copying the list of sites and locations to a Word document. In the sample, there are currently 10 zones and 60+ locations, some of which are no longer in use.

3. Modify your Site/Location list to correspond with your new org chart. You can structure the Site/Location page of PATH in various ways, such as organizing by locations as zones or by cohort start dates. Sites are typically displayed in a bolded blue font and often represent zones in your organization.

# Locations

Locations are not bolded and under the Locations heading. They are usually districts.

## Plan

4. Rename Sites and Locations in a uniform manner

Your naming convention can be either place names or numbers, but it is advantageous to preface all names with a short name common to all, such as the area name.

5. Make the changes in PATH

Student transfers and missionary assignments will be more efficient since all your locations will be sorted together in the lists.
