# Sunday Visits With Wards And Stakes Increase Awareness About Byu-Pathway

## Ward Visits

Visiting wards on a Sunday allows you to:

- Build relationships
- Be visible
- Meet with ward members and leaders
- Answer questions
- Share promotional materials

Visiting a ward often leads to:

- Trust
- Invitations to receive referrals
- Opportunities to give presentations

Consider beginning with stakes who have called a BYU-Pathway stake representative. If possible, contact the stake representative or the welfare and self-reliance manager beforehand, but it is not required when making ward visits. Next, pray about which wards to visit. Rely on the powers of heaven and revelation to help you accomplish the Lord's work of ministering through education.

## Planning Sunday Ward Visits

1. **Before Your Visit:**
- Use PATH to find previous, current, and non-completing students who are members of the ward. Contact a few individuals to gather information about the ward.
- Meet with the stake representative. Below are example questions you may consider asking him:
- Who in the ward will benefit from a BYU-Pathway experience?
- Who in the ward (leaders or members) is interested in visiting with us?
- Are there members in the ward who strongly support BYU-Pathway?
- What are the ward's spiritual goals?
- What efforts are being made to help the youth progress?
- What are the goals regarding temple attendance?
- What type of temporal/spiritual welfare service happens in the ward?
- How do the leaders emphasize loving-kindness?
- Is family history actively being promoted?
- Is there a sense of belonging within the membership?

2. **When You Visit:**
- Wear your missionary badge. Members will be interested in your mission and experiences.
- Share the benefits of BYU-Pathway and answer questions when bishops or other leaders come to talk with you.
- Minister to current and former students. Ask to sit by them in meetings and ask them to introduce you to members.
- Talk about BYU-Pathway in a meeting when invited. Be enthusiastic, brief, and clear. Ask a student to share their experience.
- Leave pass along cards with your contact information, flyers, and bulletin board posters if directed by the Spirit.
- Offer to explain BYU-Pathway in a future visit to the bishop or other leaders. Create awareness by:
- Presenting in elders quorum/Relief Society or giving a 2nd hour lesson
- Speaking in sacrament meeting about the doctrine of education
- Offering to be available to serve members with spiritual or educational needs

## Tips When Visiting

# Respect the Bishop's Time and Plan

- Be prepared with extra handouts and materials for leaders.
- Leave the bishop with a list of students from his ward (search PATH by the stake name).
- Use handouts as a conversation starter.
- Ask permission to hang chapel posters on bulletin boards.
- Add your contact information to all documents.
- Bear testimony and share student experiences.
- Use the ward announcement templates.
- Be prepared to explain BYU-Pathway in 30 seconds.
- Be prepared to explain Englishconnect in 30 seconds.

## Alternatives to Ward Visits

Visiting a ward and stake can be a valuable experience. However, there are circumstances that may prevent a visit such as distance, health limitations, or church callings. The next best option is to use various communication methods to stay connected.

## Planning a Communication Strategy

1. **Work with the Stake Representative:**
- It is recommended to hold regular phone or Zoom meetings.
- Discuss awareness activities that are appropriate for the stake.
- Consider the following activities:
- Organize a virtual BYU-Pathway devotional for stake members.
- Share flyers about BYU-Pathway sponsored webinars.
- Share social media posts on ward and stake Facebook pages.
- Encourage emails to all adult members.
- Post on ward bulletin announcements.

2. **Identify Other Leaders Who Can Help:**
- Focus on building relationships with others who live and serve in the wards. This may include:
- Elders quorum and Relief Society presidents: They are often willing to forward emails about the program with members. They may be willing to share brief announcements or make short presentations during Relief Society or Elders Quorum. A Relief Society may have a Facebook page where BYU-Pathway events can be posted.
- BYU-Pathway Alumni or current students: Lists are found in PATH. Gather information about the ward and ask if they are willing to help increase awareness by distributing flyers and posting information on bulletin boards. Students and alumni are effective advocates for the program. They can also request Relief Society or elders quorum presidents to host a virtual presentation.
- Family members or friends living in the ward or stake: They may be willing to pass along or post information about BYU-Pathway in their ward or stake.

3. **Plan a Trip:**
- Plan a vacation near the distant ward or stake. Introduce yourself as a missionary serving with BYU-Pathway in the classes you attend.
