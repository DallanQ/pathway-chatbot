## Dear Brothers And Sisters:

## Missionary Name Badges For Senior Service Missionaries

Recently the First Presidency approved a name change, where the terms Church-service Missionary and CSM, were retired and replaced with service missionary. To distinguish them from young service missionaries, those who were previously called CSMs will now be referred to as senior service missionaries.

As part of this name change, the Service Mission Office will also be standardizing the format and titles on all service missionary name badges. The new format will allow others to easily identify that the member is serving as a service missionary, regardless of their assignment.

## See Example, With Name Badge Specifications:

We invite all departments to now begin ordering badges for their senior service missionaries in this standardized format. Deseret Manufacturing is now prepared to fulfill your name badge orders using this approved format.

We appreciate your partnership and cooperation in making this change. We are grateful for the opportunities you provide for members to serve. We know that those who labor as service missionaries will be blessed to become more like the Savior as they continue to serve our Heavenly Father's children in this capacity.

Sincerely,

## Bradley Baker Director Service Mission Office
