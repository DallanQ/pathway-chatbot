# Service Missionary Escalation Policy For Helping A Student In Crisis

A service missionary may encounter various student situations that require escalation. These situations usually present themselves in three categories:

1. Student in crisis
2. Serious life situation
3. Unresolved Issue

The purpose of this document is to help you feel confident in your ability to assist students in these situations.

## Student In Crisis

**Definition:** A situation that requires immediate action to ensure the safety of the student or those around them. A student in crisis situation may include a student contemplating suicide, a student in immediate physical danger resulting from harm from another, or a student contemplating hurting another person.

**Step 1:** If you receive an email or text from a student who indicates that they are in crisis, try to reach the student via phone or text to further assess their current state. Read this article to learn more about how to handle suicidal situations.

Here are some questions you can ask to assess the student's current state:

- Are you thinking about hurting yourself?
- Are you thinking about suicide right now?
- Are you thinking about hurting others?
- Are you worried about someone hurting you?

**Step 2:** If the student answers "no" to these questions, he or she may not be in immediate danger. It is recommended that you find out who can help support the student (bishop, relief society president, elders quorum president, family, friend, neighbor, boss, co-worker, etc.)

If the student answers "yes" to these questions, proceed with the following questions:
- Have you ever thought about suicide before or tried to harm yourself before?
- Do you have a plan for how and when you would attempt suicide?
- Do you have a plan to hurt others?
- Do you know if someone plans to hurt you?

**Step 3:** If the student answers "yes" to the above questions, call 911 with them or encourage them to call 9-1-1 or local law enforcement. Provide the suicide hotline to them: #1 (800) 273-8255. For international students, Google the country for the hotline number or use this list of country suicide hotlines. Here is a sample of what you could say to the student:

> "Thank you for trusting me with this information. I want you to be able to get the help that you need at this time. Let's call 9-1-1 or the Suicide Hotline together."

**Step 4:** In all cases where a student is in crisis, after helping the student, report immediately to your zone or district leader for counsel on how to proceed, and let the student know you will follow up with him or her within 3 days. Immediately inform BYU-Pathway Support if you feel like a student's situation is severe.

## Serious Life Situation

**Definition:** A situation in which the student's health or safety may be compromised or the student has a significant impediment to them continuing in the program.

# Serious Life Situations

- Mental health concerns
- Natural disasters
- Abusive situations
- Extreme financial distress
- Lack of employment, home, or basic needs
- Death of a family member

If you encounter a student who is experiencing a serious life situation that impedes their ability to continue in the program, suggest that he or she reach out to their local priesthood leader. If the student is in PC 101, you can also suggest they contact their mentor. A mentor can help a student determine what kind of support they have, what kind of support has helped in the past, brainstorming with students on what support they can utilize, and develop a student-led action plan.

If you determine the student's situation is extreme, contact BYU-Pathway Support by chat or email. Provide the support agent with the student name, ID number, and brief description of the situation.

## Unresolved Issue

**Definition:** A situation that you are unsure of how to handle and falls outside of student in crisis or serious life situations. This would most typically be when the student has reached out to other recommended resources but has not heard back or their issue is still unresolved.

If you determine the student's situation is extreme, contact BYU-Pathway Support. It is also recommended you contact your zone or district leader to council together on how to proceed.
