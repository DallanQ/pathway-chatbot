# Updating Your Zoom Room Passcode Zoom

Your Zoom room passcode keeps your Zoom room safe. This is different from your Zoom login password. Never give your Zoom login password to anyone.

Your passcode is a six-digit number that is automatically generated for you. It can be changed at any time.

## Steps to Update Your Zoom Room Passcode:

1. Open your Zoom desktop app and log in to your account.
2. Click on **Meetings** in the top menu.
3. Select your Zoom meeting room and click on **Edit**.
4. Enter a new passcode in the field provided.
5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the window.

> Note: Only update your Zoom room passcode after your group has completed Pathwayconnect, unless instructed by your area leaders.

Changing your passcode breaks the Zoom link for the students in their portal. Any changes to your Zoom link should be communicated to your zone or district leaders.
