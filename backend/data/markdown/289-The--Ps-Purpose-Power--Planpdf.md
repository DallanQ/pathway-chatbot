# Help Students Connect With A Purpose, Power, And A Plan Shepherding

Our ultimate objective is to help students move along their path towards success. The 3 P's can help you support students in this endeavor.

## Establish A Purpose

Purpose is about finding that desire that will help motivate students through future challenges. Some students may desire to better provide for their family, be the first to graduate, or set an example for their children. Students may struggle if they have lost their purpose or never had one to begin with.

- Expand your students' vision of their divine potential by reminding them of who they want to become.
- Assist students in discovering or remembering why they joined BYU-Pathway Worldwide.
- Remind them of the goals they are passionate about achieving.
- Help them connect their core values to their education.

## Helping Students Increase Power

Heavenly Father has blessed us with resources that give us power to succeed. When students begin to doubt their abilities or get overwhelmed in their work, they need a reminder of the tools available to them.

- Build your students' confidence in themselves.
- Guide them to Jesus Christ and the enabling power of His Atonement.
- Help students explore additional support resources.
- Share personal experiences of how you've found power.

## Advance With A Plan

When students have a plan, they will be able to face challenges with greater faith and confidence. Whether they struggle with fear or a lack of support, helping students to answer, "How do I get there from here?" will lead them to discover what they can do now to get them to where they want to go.

- Encourage students to make plans and goals.
- Inspire students to act in faith.
- Empower students to be self-reliant.
- Hold students accountable to their goals.
