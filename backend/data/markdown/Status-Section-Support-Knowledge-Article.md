**1\. Monitoring Status**


| (BYU\-Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| You can monitor the application process. Here is a link to the BYU Pathway [Admissions](https://www.byupathway.org/admissions). Once you have completed (including selecting "Save \& Continue") each section of the application the status summary will have a "Submit" button in the top right corner of the status box. Once that button appears you should select it to submit your application. All green check marks along the top of the box will indicate that all sections have been completed successfully. Checkmarks along the left side will indicate when the application is complete (meaning that all transcripts have been processed and the endorsement is complete).​Once all of the check marks on the left are green the application will automatically go to the Admission Team to be given a decision. |
