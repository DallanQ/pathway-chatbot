# Second Hour Presentation Increasing Awareness

## Logistical Considerations

- **Consider "Who is your audience?"**
- Try to direct your message to those attending.

- **Where are you presenting?**
- Large rooms, like the cultural hall, work better with larger TV screens for video presentations. Use a smaller room for other TV sizes.

- **How much time do you have for your presentation?**
- Recommend taking less time than you are given to account for late starts, comments, and questions.

- **Do you need audio/visual equipment for the room?**
- Is there a projector or TV (large/small) available? What connectors or cables are needed with your personal equipment?
- Use a printable interest list.

## Preparation

- Research the ward or stake you will visit using PATH. Search by the official name of the ward or stake. Take note of the past student participation.
- **IMPORTANT:** Do not share student information (names, registration information, contact information) in the ward or stake report aloud during the meeting.
- Inform local leaders you are working with the LCR report for BYU-Pathway found in Leader and Clerk Resources, under Membership.
- Note: Review the Local Leader Student Enrollment List training article for more information about this report.

- Consider asking one or two students if they would like to participate in the presentation. Understand the student's story before asking them to participate.
- You may want to ask:
- How has BYU-Pathway blessed their lives?
- What is their path to BYU-Pathway story?
- What support or learning outcomes have they gained?
- Have you experienced spiritual growth?

- Review with the leader(s) their direction. Share your presentation ideas and/or slides with them in advance.
- Ask if the leaders would like to invite any specific individuals.
- Reaching out beforehand will prepare them for the discussion and help develop good questions.
