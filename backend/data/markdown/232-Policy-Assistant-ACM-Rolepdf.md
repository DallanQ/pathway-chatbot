### Policy – Assistant Area Coordination Missionary Policy (Assistant Acm)

BYU-Pathway Worldwide, Field Operations adopted the policy that each area manager is permitted to have one Area Coordination Missionary (ACM) (couple or individual) for each area of the church to assist the area manager. Similar to area managers, ACMs carry a heavy workload in assisting in the work to provide educational opportunities to BYU-Pathway students. To assist in spreading the workload of area managers and ACMs in a scalable manner, each area manager is permitted to have Assistant ACMs and Zone Leaders as needed for their area. It is important that each area focuses on improving communication within the leadership structure for transparency, efficiency, and scalability.
