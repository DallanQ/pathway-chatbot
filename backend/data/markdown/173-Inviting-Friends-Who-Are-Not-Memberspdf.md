# Inviting Friends Who Are Not Members To BYU-Pathway: Increasing Awareness

## Purpose

Many students join BYU-Pathway because of its spiritual component. Recent surveys show that when students not of our faith are asked to learn about the gospel, over 90% accept the invitation. Roughly 30% of those students are baptized. Think about the impact if more of our friends and friends of our students were invited to join BYU-Pathway.

## Faith To Invite

The Spirit will guide our words when we invite (D&C 33:8-10).

8 Open your mouths and they shall be filled, and you shall become even as Nephi of old, who journeyed from Jerusalem in the Wilderness.

9 Yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo, I am with you.

10 Yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled, saying: Repent, repent, and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

## Overcoming Fears

We may have fears or concerns about inviting others. Surveys show that the number one reason for Friends of the Church to join BYU-Pathway is because of the spiritual component of the program. While we don't want to put pressure on our friends to sign up, it is important that they are aware of this educational opportunity and how they can draw closer to our Savior.

Ideas for inviting students to learn more about BYU-Pathway:

- Pray for opportunities and guidance about who would need this opportunity.
- Ask leaders in your stake or ward for names of those who might benefit from a BYU-Pathway experience.
- Pray to know what to say and just start talking.
- Ask about their educational goals and how BYU-Pathway might help them accomplish those goals.
- Focus on the spiritual components of the program and how it blesses your life and the life of families.

## Conclusion

- Pray to know who you can invite to join BYU-Pathway. If possible, consider asking your ward council for names of those who might be interested.
