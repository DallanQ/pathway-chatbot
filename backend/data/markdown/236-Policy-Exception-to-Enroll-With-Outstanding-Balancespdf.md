# Peg Minute: Exception To Enroll With Outstanding Balances

July 8, 2020

## Proposed exception to allow students to continue Pathwayconnect registration with outstanding balances:

- It was discussed that we need to provide an exception for students with a balance on their account to register for the next semester.
- If a student with a current C+ grade or better appeals our current policy, which does not allow students with an outstanding balance to register for the next semester, they may be granted an exception if they pay something on the balance owed.
- They will be advised to pay at least 25%.
