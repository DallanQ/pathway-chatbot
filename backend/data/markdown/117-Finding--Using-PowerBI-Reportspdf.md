## Using Power Reports

Let's say you want to see all missionaries that live in your area but have assignments in other areas.

- Click The Active Missionaries Report Button.
- Point Anywhere On This Data Sheet.

Notice the buttons that appear while you are pointing.

Click this button. This will display an expanded view of the Data Sheet.

Notice the heading of this column, "Assigned Church Area". This is the column that shows the area each missionary has an assignment.

If you scroll to the right in this Data Sheet, you will see a column heading that says, "Living Church Area".

Note that both headings appear in the Filters section on the right side of the screen.

To see only the missionaries in this list that live in your area, click LIVING CHURCH AREA and scroll down to check the box next to your area.

To start another filter, click the reset icon to reset the Data Sheet to all data, then start your new filter.
