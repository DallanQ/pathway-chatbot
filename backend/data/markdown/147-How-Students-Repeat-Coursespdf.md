# How Students Repeat Courses Pathwayconnect

## Who is this article for?
Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, and Zone Leaders

**Purpose:**
This article explains how students can take courses again to improve their GPA. You will also learn how this applies to students who have taken courses in the old curriculum.

Students should not feel bad when they receive a poor grade for a Pathwayconnect course. Those students may repeat the course to obtain a better grade. This policy helps students keep alive the goal of obtaining a certificate or degree, even if they have had a bad term.

## How To Repeat A Course

### Register To Repeat A Course For Current Students
Students register to repeat a course by accessing their student portal.

### Register To Repeat A Course For Returning Students
Students who are not currently enrolled will not be able to register through their portal. They will have to register through byupathway.edu.

## How Many Times Can a Student Repeat a Course?
Courses may be repeated as many times as needed without damaging a student's GPA.

## Do Students Need to Repeat a Gathering?
Yes. When students repeat a course, they also repeat the gatherings. The student may ask for a gathering waiver by contacting their mentor or an enrollment counselor. They can also make the request using the chatbot in the student portal.

## How Are Grades Measured When a Student Repeats a Course?
When a student retakes a course, the new grade replaces the old grade, and only the new grade is used to compute the student's GPA.

## Do Students Need to Repeat All Courses in Pathwayconnect?
The student only needs to repeat the course(s) where they received a poor grade. For example, if the student received a poor grade in PC 102 but good grades in 101 and 103, only PC 102 needs to be repeated.

# Students Who Have Taken Courses In The Old Curriculum

## How Students Repeat Courses

Under the terms of the curriculum started in January 2020, the following rules apply:

1. PC 101/L replaces GSPC 120/L

2. Students who need to repeat ENG 106 or MATH 100G from the old curriculum should register for PC 102

3. Students who have completed two semesters in the old Pathwayconnect curriculum AND PC 102 can matriculate without taking PC 103.

The following shows which new curriculum courses must be taken to make up for old courses.

## New

- PC 101
- PC 102

## Old

- GS 120
- MATH 100, ENG 106

If students pass the 3 courses in the old curriculum with a 3.0 or better, they can matriculate.
