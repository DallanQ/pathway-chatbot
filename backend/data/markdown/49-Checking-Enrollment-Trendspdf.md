## PURPOSE:

This article demonstrates how to use the PC New Funnel - Overview in Power BI to monitor enrollment and predict missionary needs.

For a reminder of how to access the Power BI reports, search for the article How to Find Power BI Reports.

### Why check enrollment trends?

- Forecast the number of missionaries your area will need.
- Avoid surprises in enrollment surges or sudden drops in enrollment.
- Plan for missionaries by checking early in the enrollment period and then check periodically to evaluate trends.

1. In the Power BI report, select the arrow to the right of PC New in the options on the left of the screen.
2. Click on the arrow to the right of PC Funnel and select Overview.
3. Click on the filter icon in the upper right side of the screen to open the Filters.
4. Select the Area filter and click on your area.
- Additionally, select 1 or more countries if needed.
5. Choose the necessary page specific filters from the options available on the left side of the report page.
- Commonly used filters are the current term, Net Enroll, and Net Enroll/Start.
6. The upper graph shows a numerical representation of enrollment numbers over a length of time.
- Click on the Focus View icon located slightly above the right side of the graph to enlarge the view.
7. View the graph legend at the top of the page to identify the different trend lines.
- The black slider bar beneath the graph allows you to adjust the view according to Date.
8. An early signal to watch for with enrollment trends is when the current enrollment line crosses the previous semester and goal trend lines.
- Checking a few days after the lines cross is a way to get an early idea of missionary needs.
- Hovering your cursor over a date will trigger a pop-up displaying enrollment Information As Of That Specific Day.

# To Calculate Missionary Needs Projection

9. To calculate a projection for missionary needs, you will need to convert the percentage shown at the base of the pop up on a specific day. This percentage shows the difference between actual enrollment on that day and **The Enrollment Goal**.

- If the percentage is positive, add 1 to the decimal. Example: 45% would be 0.45 + 1 = 1.45.
- If the percentage is negative, add to the decimal. Example: -% would be - + = ..

10. Find the goal number for enrollment after the auto drop date by locating the Goal trend line and following it to the end where the enrollment number is displayed. If you do not see Goal in the graph legend, the numbers have not been added yet. Remember to collect the enrollment number after auto drop, otherwise your calculations will be too high.

11. Multiply the goal enrollment after auto drop number by the adjusted percentage decimal to calculate a projected number of students for the term.

- Example: 1810 (goal after auto drop) x 1.45 (adjusted percentage) = 2624.5

The projection is that 2625 students will continue.

12. Next, divide the expected number of students by the maximum desired number of students for your group.

- Example: 2625 (expected students) รท 30 (max number of students in a group) = 87.5.

This means that you will need missionaries to handle 88 gatherings for your incoming student load.

13. Continuing to monitor the trends may show a percentage change. This will help you adjust your projected missionary needs as the date nears **the Beginning Of The Term**.
