# Defining Characteristics Of BYU-Pathway Worldwide Developing A Pioneer'S Heart

## "Handcart Pioneers" Minerva Tiechert

February 7, 2017, will forever be imprinted in our history. Not only is this the date that BYU-Pathway Worldwide was announced; it is also the date that all full-time Pathway employees were asked to leave Rexburg for Salt Lake City, where the new organization would be established.

Like our pioneering forebears in the Church who left behind homes and communities they cherished to follow a greater cause, the employees of BYU-Pathway — both current and future — make sacrifices to offer higher education to Church members throughout the world. Each of our sacrifices are individual, personal, and unique. And it's in these offerings that BYU-Pathway employees embrace the Pioneer's Heart as they dedicate themselves to building the Kingdom Of God.

## Obedience to Prophetic & Inspired Direction

We are guided by prophetic direction from the leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Moreover, each of us as BYU-Pathway Worldwide employees actively seeks and acts upon inspiration through the Spirit in our individual work to bless God's children through higher education.

## Faith & Optimism for the Unknown

Being part of a pioneering Church educational institution brings excitement and growth, and with growth comes change. At BYU-Pathway, we work on the frontier by embracing change with open hearts and willing minds.

## Personal Sacrifice & Dedication

Since the announcement of BYU-Pathway Worldwide, employees have packed up, left homes and communities, and moved their families to support the growth of the organization. This continues the pattern of dedicating our time and talents to improving lives around the world.

## Humility & Frugality

BYU-Pathway was born out of BYU-Idaho, an institution that through humility and frugality strives to serve "as many students as possible within resource constraints." Likewise, we strive to be stewards of consecrated resources, offering up our talents with meekness. It is in this spirit that we work to do more with less and to take correction when needed. In doing so, the Lord magnifies our abilities.

## Collaboration

At BYU-Pathway, we work across boundaries both internally and externally. This requires us to counsel with our colleagues and leaders. We believe that accomplishing the work includes acting with respect, deference, and a spirit of teamwork and camaraderie.

## Concern for the One

Working for BYU-Pathway is not just a job — it's a belief in a cause that matters. We are passionate about the success of each student. By "thinking like our users" and focusing on their needs, we find ways to support and lift students no matter their economic, cultural, and personal circumstances.
