# Pre-Semester Gatherings

## New Learner Visit

**Purpose:** This article will offer suggestions for different ways to conduct your New Learner Visits using general meetings in combination with shorter individual meetings.

The purpose of the New Learner Visit is to help each learner:
- Know how to attend the gathering
- Understand the program and expectations
- Develop confidence in their abilities
- Create a relationship with the missionaries
- Understand how they will be supported during the course

The New Learner Visit is your first personal connection with a learner.

## Meetings Before The First Gathering

- Needed topics can be addressed all at once in a private meeting with each learner.
- Another way is to give the general information in a meeting (Pre-Semester Gathering) with many learners. This is then followed by shorter private meetings with each learner.
- Personal information is best shared in a private visit.

## Scheduling

**IN PERSON AND VIRTUAL GATHERINGS**
- Schedule pre-gathering meetings on the same day and time that your gatherings will be held.
- You may need to host one to three meetings before the first gathering to be sure everyone can attend.
- Allow yourself enough time for short private visits with each learner. These can be either before and/or after the meeting or at other times convenient for the student.

**IN PERSON GATHERINGS**
- District or zone leaders can help make sure the building is available and open for the Pre-Gathering Meeting.

## Preparation

**CONTACTING**
- Use your learner roster in PATH to get contact information. Send emails, texts, or Whatsapp messages to the learners with choices of day and time, as well as the location for the pre-gathering meeting.
- Consider using a scheduling web tool to sign up learners for private meeting time slots. Otherwise, you may develop your own scheduling document.
- Be sure to use blind carbon copy (Bcc) when emailing the group. See the training article for data privacy for help or ask your zone or district leader.

## Getting To Know Each Other

**IN PERSON GATHERINGS**
- Encourage learners to come early or stay after. This way they can meet other learners in a common area. You may consider having light

# Refreshments

Consider providing discussion topics or questions learners can use as you meet with learners before or after the main meeting.

## Virtual Gatherings

Encourage learners to come early or stay after the main meeting. This way they can meet other learners. Consider providing discussion topics or questions learners can use to talk with each other while you meet individually with other learners in breakout rooms before or after the main meeting.

## Pre-Semester Gathering

This meeting can be organized in two ways.

1. **Students/Missionaries With A Good Internet Connection:**

Plan the general meetings to be held weeks before the first gathering. Schedule personal meetings with students in time slots before and after the general meeting.

Encourage students to mingle in the main Zoom room while you meet one on one with individual students in a breakout room.

2. **Students/Missionaries With Limited Internet Connection:**

Host a short meeting with everyone in attendance describing the gathering expectations and procedures.

Individual meetings can then be held how it is best for the student: by short zoom meetings, by phone, texting or with Whatsapp.

The cost for data can be less expensive when combining a short meeting as a group followed by individual meetings with each student using other less costly communication tools.

## Virtual Pre-Semester Gathering

The New Learner Visit instructions lists questions and topics for the New Learner Visit and the Pre-Semester Gathering meeting. Ask private or personal information in the individual visits with learners.

**SUGGESTED OUTLINE**
- Prayer
- Introduce yourselves (talk about your family, where you live, Church experience, etc.)
- Have a brief learner introduction activity.
- Discuss the Purpose of EC3
- Show the Learner Portal
- How to be Successful
- Welcome Friends of the Church
- Close with your testimony and offer a prayer

## Show The Ec3 Online Practice Platform

## Virtual Pre-Semester Gathering

More information for New Student Visits can be found on the Missionary Services website under the Englishconnect 3 dropdown, in the New Learner Visit category.

Remember to take good notes during the meeting. Always ask for permission before you take pictures. Use any pictures and information gathered only for your private use and follow FERPA guidelines.

# Personal Follow-Up Visits

Since some topics such as "Get to know the learner" in the New Student Visit Outline is best addressed in a private setting, below is a suggested outline for private visits following the general Pre-Gathering meeting. Continue to schedule New Learner Visits even if the semester has begun. Personal visits with Friends of the Church and less active learners should be a top priority.

## Suggested Outline

1. **Re-Introduce Yourselves Briefly**

2. *Get to know the learner*

3. **Address Obstacles To Success**

4. Follow-up with learners during the week to see if they had any concerns or questions. Often, learners will have questions about computer or internet problems, the learning app, transportation, or other technical help.
