# Church Hr Annual Workforce Training Byu-Pathway

## Introduction

As a Church missionary, your safety and well-being are of utmost importance. To help create a safe and wholesome environment, you have been enrolled in the Required Annual Missionary and Volunteer Training Courses.

The principles and practices taught in these trainings are designed to protect you, those you serve with, and the Lord's Church. All missionaries and volunteers are required to take courses each year to meet legal compliance requirements of the Church and to provide essential information for safety and individual well-being. All employees of the workforce are required to do the same.
