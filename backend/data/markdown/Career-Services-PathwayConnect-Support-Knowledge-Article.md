**1\. Church Living Wage**


| Information |
| --- |
| What is Church Living Wage?   Church Living Wage is a dollar amount by country that shows the amount needed to support a family and serve in the kingdom of God.    How is Church Living Wage determined?   The Institutional Research Department at BYU\-Pathway Worldwide does extensive research to determine what Church Living Wage in a country should be. |


**2\. Jobs**


|  |
| --- |
| I need a job. How do I get one?  If the student is an international PathwayConnect student with a 50% Heber J. Grant Scholarship, see the Tier 1 Jobs section.  If the student is an international Online Degree student, see the TalentConnect section.     What are the tiers with jobs?   The work of placing students into jobs at BYU\-Pathway is grouped into three tiers:   * Tier 1 Jobs: Entry\-level/Work\-study  * Pay: 25% Church Living Wage * Education Stage: PathwayConnect * Work Required: Project\-based, focused on student reliability, often done from a mobile device  * Tier 2 Jobs: Degree\-specific  * Pay: 50% Church Living Wage * Education Stage: First/Second Certificate * Work required: Project\-based track\-oriented, English requirement, laptop needed  * Tier 3 Jobs:  * Pay: Church Living Wage * Education Stage: Third Certificate/Degree * Work Required: Career employment aligned with certificates and degrees, professional internships, managerial responsibilities    I applied for a job with \[insert company] and they rejected me. Why?   All hiring decisions made by companies are made independently of BYU\-Pathway Worldwide and BYU\-Pathway Worldwide plays no role in their hiring decisions.     My friend has a job with BYU\-Pathway as a \[insert position] and I want one too. How can I get one?   Most positions for international students that service BYU\-Pathway are hired through a separate company called Bloom. BYU\-Pathway plays no role in Bloom’s hiring decisions. You can apply for a job on their website, [https://hirebloom.com](https://www.hirebloom.com/).    I was rejected for a job and told I don’t speak English well, but English is my native language. What advice would you give me?    I'm sorry to hear about your experience. It must be frustrating to face a rejection based on language proficiency when English is your native language. It's possible that the employer may have had difficulty understanding your accent. To address this, you might consider working on clear and concise communication. Practice speaking slowly, enunciating your words, and seeking feedback from friends or mentors. Remember, it's not a reflection of your abilities, but rather an opportunity for growth and refinement. BYU\-Pathway is also in the process of building tools to help students achieve a global English accent.     I have no work experience but I want a job. How can I get an employer to consider me?  BYU\-Pathway is working to build relationships with employers who are looking to hire entry\-level BYU\-Pathway students. These jobs will first go to the students in the most financial need.     How can I better prepare to be ready for a job?   BYU\-Pathway students can access the Professional Skills section of the [BYU\-Pathway Resource Center](https://resourcecenter.byupathway.edu/skills) for tools and guides on how to prepare for jobs and hiring processes.     When going to employers, they ask for proof of enrollment in BYU\-Pathway to consider me. How can I show them I am enrolled as a BYU\-Pathway student?  PathwayConnect Students: Sign in to your student portal, click your name in the top right\-hand corner, and click on “Enrollment Verification.”   BYU\-Idaho Online Degree Students: To obtain proof of Enrollment, please go into their Student Portal, click on Resources, and Enrollment Verification.     Ensign College: If the student needs a document verifying enrollment at Ensign College or has questions, they should send a request to [regstaff@ensign.edu](mailto:regstaff@ensign.edu). The email should include their name, student ID number, and where the enrollment verification needs to be sent.      See PC – Enrollment Verification and OD – Enrollment Statuses \& Subprograms for additional information.    **Avoiding Scams\- I received a message from an employer, how do I know if I can trust it?** BYU\-Pathway Worldwide is partnering with many companies and staffing agencies to provide job opportunities to students. Approved job opportunities will always come through official BYU\-Pathway Worldwide channels, which include email and Job Alert WhatsApp groups and you can fully trust these are legitimate job opportunities. Employers utilizing the Crescendo hiring platform are also approved.  If you receive something from a specific person or company not mentioned above, it may not be legitimate and could present a risk to respond. |


**3\. Tier 1 Jobs (Formerly Work\-Study Jobs)**


| Information |
| --- |
| **What is a** Tier 1 **job?** Tier 1 jobs are for eligible students currently enrolled in PathwayConnect courses. These jobs pay around minimum wage for the country the student lives in and students are eligible to work eight hours a day, five days a week. Tier 1 jobs are typically one year in length.     **Who is eligible?** Students must:  * Be enrolled in PathwayConnect * Be 18 years of age or older * Be the recipient of the 50% Heber J. Grant Scholarship * Live in a select focus area where employment needs are the greatest * Not be serving a full\-time mission    What is TalentConnect for Tier 1?   TalentConnect is a talent marketplace where employers find BYU\-Pathway students to place into Tier 1 jobs. The student interface for TalentConnect for Tier 1 is in the BYU\-Pathway BOT.     How do I indicate my interest in a Tier 1 job?   Students who are eligible for a Tier 1 job will have a “Tier 1 Jobs” button when they access the BOT from their student profile. See this [demo video](https://screenpal.com/watch/cZVZqlVJk0U) for more information.     Who built TalentConnect for Tier 1?   TalentConnect for Tier 1 was built by the BYU\-Pathway Digital Operations team.     What is the employer approval process for TalentConnect for Tier 1?   The BYU\-Pathway Career Development team has a rigorous screening process and agreements for employer access to TalentConnect.     How soon will jobs be available?   Jobs might not be available immediately for students. As we launch TalentConnect for Tier 1, seeing student demand will help us know how to best engage employers to help us meet these goals. BYU\-Pathway does not guarantee jobs for students. Instead, BYU\-Pathway amplifies our students own efforts to qualify for, search, obtain, and retain employment.    How much do Tier 1 jobs pay?   Tier 1 jobs pay around minimum wage in a country. Rates vary by country based on Church Living Wage in the country. Students are told their hourly pay rate during the hiring process.     What do I do after completing my Tier 1  profile?   After indicating an interest in a role, all you need to do is to keep an eye on your preferred contact method to see if any employer reaches out.     Employers will screen the candidates who indicated an interest in the roles they are hiring for and contact selected candidates for the next steps. All hiring decisions are independently made by the companies BYU\-Pathway Worldwide works with. BYU\-Pathway Worldwide does not influence hiring decisions.    NOTE: To be considered for the role selected, you should have selected “Yes” to these questions when creating your TalentConnect account:  1\. I am interested in a Tier 1 position.  2\. I give permission for my information to be shared with third\-party hiring firms and employers.    To be sure you have answered “Yes” to them, go to “Update Profile” on the homepage.    What Tier 1 jobs are currently available?  At this time, some Tier 1 jobs are available through FamilySearch. The number of open positions depends on various project needs (i.e. language, geography, etc.). |


**4\. Crescendo (Tier 2/3\)**

It is white\-labeled to look like a BYU\-Pathway site. All proper agreements are in place to ensure student data is protected and employers use the platform properly.     What is the ProScore?  The ProScore is a predictive analytics model that shows which students are most likely to be successful in employment. The ProScore is made up of several factors including:   * Education * English * Technology/Hardware * Internet Speed * Service in the Church * Focus Areas for Employment    How are hourly rates determined?  A BYU\-Pathway team determines hourly rates for students based on:  * Church Living Wage * ProScore    How is English tested?   A BYU\-Pathway team reviews videos and written summaries to test for English.     What features does Crescendo provide to employers?   TalentConnect acts as an applicant tracking system and payment service. On the platform, employers are able to:   * Review student profiles * Request interviews * Perform interviews * Extend job offers * Through the Crescendo payment platform (separate from TalentConnect), issue payments    What is the difference between TalentConnect, Crescendo, and Full\-Service Staffing?  * TalentConnect allows employers to hire directly. Employers can find, interview, and hire students themselves. * Crescendo allows employers to pay international students. * Full\-service staffing companies, such as Bloom, ClearSource, Rain Global, and HireMango, screen and locate students themselves. These companies also assume the risk of international hiring on behalf of employers.    Who decides which employers get access to Crescendo?  The BYU\-Pathway Career Development team has a rigorous screening process and agreements for employer access to TalentConnect.     How soon will jobs be available?   Jobs might not be available immediately for students. As we launch TalentConnect, seeing student demand will help us know how to best engage employers to help us meet these goals. BYU\-Pathway amplifies our students own efforts to qualify for, search, obtain, and retain employment.   I know an employer who wants to know more about hiring BYU\-Pathway students. Who do I send them to?  Have the person email [talentconnect@byupathway.org](mailto:talentconnect@byupathway.org) and a member of our employer relations team will reach out to them.     Can I see a demo video of Crescendo?  Coming soon. |
