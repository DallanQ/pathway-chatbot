This article covers the process of facilitating an In-Person Gathering from opening to closing the meeting. Additionally, you will be presented with ways you can minister to students during the gathering.

## Before The Gathering

### Before Students Arrive
- Get access to the building and arrive early to unlock doors.
- Arrive early enough to allow time for the lead student to practice if needed.
- Ensure that the room is clean and set up the chairs in a semi-circle or in small groups.
- Verify that any technology (video equipment, projectors, etc.) is working properly.

### As Students Arrive
- Stand at the door to greet each student as they arrive.

## Beginning of the Gathering

### Announcements
- Welcome students and give announcements.

### Opening Hymn/Thought And Opening Prayer
- Select a hymn to sing together or ask a student to give a spiritual thought.
- Invite someone to give the opening prayer.

### Turn Over To Lead Student
- Turn the gathering over to the lead student.

## During The Gathering Assisting With Technology
- The lead student will conduct the lesson portion of the gathering.
- You will be asked to assist the lead student with any technology if needed.

# Shepherding/Ministering to Students

- Walk from group to group to ensure students are staying on task as they work in small groups.
- Participate in group discussions and get to know the students in your gathering.
- Be aware of students who seem distracted or reserved. Find a way to reach out to those students privately after the gathering to offer support.
- Consider sitting by students who have a harder time participating or who need additional support.

## Best Practices For In-Person Gatherings

### End of the Gathering
Close the gathering after the lead student has finished their lesson.

## Closing

- Thank the lead student and bear a brief testimony.
- Remind lead and observing students to remain after the meeting for the Lead Student Feedback Session.
- Remind next week's observing student.
- Ask a student to give the closing prayer.
- Thank the group for coming. Allow time to chat.
- You may have friends of the church in your gathering. Take time to make sure they do not have any unique challenges or questions that need attention.

## Lead Student Feedback Session

- Invite the lead student and the observing student to go into a separate room.
- Conduct the Lead Student Feedback Session.
- When the session is complete, go back to the main room to chat with students until they leave.
- Ensure that the room is clean, and chairs are put away if needed.
- Remember to lock up the building after everyone has left and turn off all the lights in the building unless another local leader is present.

## Additional Ministering Ideas

- Spend additional time with your students by attending Institute. This is not required. This time with your students can strengthen your relationship with them.
- Remember which students are active, less active, and friends of the church. Take time after class to address doubts with students.
- Attend different institute classes so students have support from several companionships.
- You might try using nametags for the first few weeks of gatherings and institute.

## Additional Ministering Ideas

- Be prepared to give blessings to students if requested.
- Help students see how networking is a lifelong skill that they are learning.

**Their Gatherings**

- Take pictures with students and of everyone together.
- Work under priesthood keys. Ask local church leaders to attend and offer feedback.
- Use zone/district meetings as an opportunity to collaborate regarding students' needs.
