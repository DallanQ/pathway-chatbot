**4\. Delays**


| PWOL BYU\-I Information |
| --- |
| **For students concerned about delays in receiving their certificate or diploma, please refer to the below information:** **SEARCH EMAILS:**For students who are inquiring if their physical certificate/diploma is on the way, please have them first check their BYU\-Idaho email account.Students receive emails throughout the entire application process: through the review of their application, for the award of the certificate/diploma, when their certificate/diploma is put in the mail, and with access to their eCertificate, etc.Oftentimes those emails get lost with the others a student may have, so if they can check for those emails (from [graduation@byui.edu](mailto:graduation@byui.edu "mailto:graduation@byui.edu") or Michael Sutter\- a third\-party diploma partner) they often will find what they are looking for.**CERTIFICATES/DIPLOMAS AWARDED ONCE A SEMESTER:** BYU\-Idaho no longer retroactively awards degrees or certificates. This means that certificates/diplomas will not be awarded immediately. If a student applies for a certificate/diploma that they completed three semesters ago, they will need to be aware that they will be awarded the certificate/diploma for that **current semester**. BYU\-Idaho will wait andaward certificates/diplomas with the rest of the qualifying applicants for that semester. **OTHER:**If a student knows that they have applied for a certificate/diploma and they haven’t received any email notifications about it within two weeks after applying, you can refer them to BYU\-Idaho at [graduation@byui.edu](mailto:graduation@byui.edu "mailto:graduation@byui.edu"). |
