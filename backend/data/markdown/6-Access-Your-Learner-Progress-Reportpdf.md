# Access Your Learner Progress Report Englishconnect 3

## Introduction
You will need to be able to answer three questions to effectively shepherd your learners each week:
1. How many units have my learners completed each week?
2. How many units have my learners completed in each skill?
3. How many of my learners are not making progress?

You can find the answers to these questions using the Learner Progress Report. This report is updated twice a week on Saturdays and Tuesdays at 9pm MST.

## Finding Your Report
First, find your report by going to the Englishconnect dropdown menu and hover over the Learner Progress Report arrow. Next, click on Learner Progress Report.

Be sure to hover over the arrow next to Learner Progress Report.

## Search for Your Area, Then Last Name
Each group has a unique report. Your report is listed by your last name or your companion's last name. You will have more than one report if you have multiple gatherings.

Click on your name, and your report will open in a new browser window.

View a learner's skill level completed in each category. Learners progress to level 4. A learner with a 2 indicates they have completed level 2. They are now working on level 3.

> Shepherding Opportunity: Reach out to learners who are not completing assignments. Ask how you can help. Counsel with your zone/district leader or Englishconnect specialist about ways to support students with severe challenges.

> Student Confidentiality: Be sure to be sensitive to your students and their progress, but never share individual information.

You may share the total submissions for the entire group with your learners. This focus on a group goal can build unity and fellowship.
