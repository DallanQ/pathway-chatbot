Ensign College students do not use the BYU\-Idaho Degree Audit. This article is intended for BYU\-Idaho students only.  
 


**Important Terms:**   
**Residency –** Residency means that the course was taken from BYU\-Idaho and was taken while you were/are attending BYU\-Idaho.  
**In\-Progress –** A class that you are currently registered for but have not yet received a grade for. This will be marked as “IP” in the Degree Audit.  
 


**1\. What is a Degree Audit**




| (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| A Degree Audit details your graduation requirements for your selected degree. It will list the total number of credits required, the residency requirements, and the course requirements for the degree you have declared.You will need to use both your Degree Audit as well as your Degree Planner to plan your studies accurately.   Please watch the BYU\-Idaho [Using the Degree Audit Tool](https://youtu.be/mtaKj-GePAw?si=n0Q23rWWdgmfx9Or) video to learn how to read and interpret a Degree Audit. You may send this video to students when needed. |


 


**2\. Degree Audit Header**




| (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| The top section of a Degree Audit (the Header) looks like the following image:This is the first section of the header of a Degree Audit. The header contains basic information to identify students. This also helps employees to know they are looking at the correct student.Starting in the top left corner of the above image and moving down and then left to right, here are the main points in this section:* **Timestamp**: A timestamp is located at the top left of the Degree Audit header. This shows when the Degree Audit was produced in order to help you make sure you are looking at the most up\-to\-date version of your Degree Audit. * **Student Name**: Under the time stamp is a section called “Student” and is where the student’s name will be. * **Current Semester**: To the right of the student’s name is a section called “Session”. This shows what the current semester was at the time the Degree Audit was produced. “FA” is for “Fall”, “WI” is for “Winter”, and “SP” is for “Spring”. The **current year** is detailed below the Session section and is titled “Year”. * **ID**: This section is located below the “Student” section and shows the student’s BYU\-Idaho I\-Number. * **Registered Hours**: This section is located below the “Year” section and shows the number of “In\-Progress” credits the student has at the time the Degree Audit is produced.  The “Advising Center”, “Faculty Mentor”, and “Grad Session/Year” sections are not used by BYU\-Pathway Worldwide students.The second portion of the Degree Audit header has all of the information about the student’s declared program – their declared certificates and degrees, as well as the catalog year they are part of. The following image is what this section looks like:Starting from the top left corner and moving from left to right and down, these are the sections found in the image above:* **Major**: A student’s major if their declared bachelor’s degree. This is listed in the “Major” section. * **Catalog**: The catalog shows which catalog year the student is part of. There are three catalog sections, “Major”, “Minor”, and “Cluster”. These should all show the same catalog year. Students cannot declare a major or certificate that is on a different catalog than the rest of their programs (certificates and degrees must be chosen from the catalog year the student is part of). * **Emphasis/Minor**: The “Emphasis” and “Minor” sections are not used at all for BYU\-Pathway Worldwide students. This is because the Pathway program does not include any minor or emphasis declarations. * **Cluster**: The cluster section will show which certificates the student has declared if the student is part of the Professional Studies degree. This section will be blank for all other degrees. |


**3\. University Requirements**




| (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| Underneath the Degree Audit Header is the University Requirements section. This will show everything the university (BYU\-Idaho) requires of all students who are enrolled in their degree programs. This section looks like the following image:This section contains a lot of information. The header to this section contains your requirements based on your declared catalog year.**GPA and Credit Requirements**The first requirement in this section is your GPA and Credit Hour requirement. There are 4 columns in this section. Similar columns are at the end of each section. The first column shows your required GPA as well as your current GPA.* The required GPA is set by BYU\-Idaho and cannot be changed or adjusted in any way. * Below the required GPA number is your current GPA calculated from all courses that contain a grade.  The second column shows any required Residency GPA.* Some universities require their students to have a specific GPA related to courses taken at that university. This is considered a Residency GPA. BYU\-Idaho does not have a requirement for a Residency GPA, so the requirement is listed as 0\.00\. * Below the Residency GPA is your GPA calculation using only courses taken directly from BYU\-Idaho.  The third column shows the Credit Hour requirement for your degree at BYU\-Idaho. Keep in mind that all students will declare a bachelor’s degree program regardless of whether they are only working towards an associate degree or a certificate only. This means that the numbers in this column will only reflect the bachelor’s degree requirements. If you wish to know if you have met the requirements for an associate degree, you will need to contact your Peer Mentor.* All current BYU\-Idaho bachelor's degrees require 120 credit hours to be completed. * The number below the Credit Requirement at BYU\-Idaho (120\) is the total number of credits you have earned through transfer courses and residency course from BYU\-Idaho combined. 	+ **NOTE:** This number can be larger than 120\. Being at 120 credit hours does not mean that you can graduate if you are missing other graduation requirements that are listed in your Degree Audit. These additional requirements will be talked about in the following sections of this article.  The fourth column shows the total number of residency credit hours you must complete from courses offered through BYU\-Idaho.* For all catalog years, the required number of residency credit hours is 30\. * The number below the required number of residency credit hours will show the total number of credit hours you have already completed from BYU\-Idaho courses. * **NOTE:** Ensign College, Institute, and BYU\-Pathway Worldwide courses are not considered residency courses at BYU\-Idaho since these courses were not taken directly from BYU\-Idaho.  **Upper\-Division Requirements** (Upper\-Division Req)This section shows the Upper Division credit hour requirements all students must complete to fulfill the Upper\-Division credit hour requirement through BYU\-Idaho.Next to the title of this section (Upper\-Division Req), on the right side of the page, contains your status of this requirement.Underneath the title is an explanation of the Upper\-Division requirements.* Upper\-division courses are courses with a 300 or higher in the course code. * For all catalog years prior to 2023, the Upper\-Division requirement is that you must complete a total of 15 credits of upper\-division courses in residency from BYU\-Idaho. This means that all 15 upper\-division credits must be taken directly from BYU\-Idaho. * For the 2023 catalog year and newer catalog years, the requirement was changed. The new requirement is that you must complete a total of 30 credit hours of upper\-division courses, but 15 of the 30 required credit hours can be transfer credits. This means that if you have 15 or more upper\-division credit hours from transfer credits, you will still need to complete a minimum of 15 credit hours of upper\-division credits directly from BYU\-Idaho.  The courses being used for the upper\-division credit calculation are listed below the requirement explanation as seen in the image below.Each course that is used for the calculation will be listed in the same way as in the image. The name of the course is listed after the stars, with the course code listed next.The semester you took the course is listed next. Please remember that “FA” means “Fall semester”, “WI” means “Winter semester”, and “SP” means “Spring semester”. Directly after the semester code is the two\-digit year in which you completed the course. “87” would mean that the course was taken in 1987, and “22” would mean that the course was taken in 2022\.Next, is the number of credit hours you were awarded for completing the course. This number will always be the same number of credits you registered for as long as you have met the minimum grade requirement. Next to the credits is the grade awarded for the class. A grade of “IP” means you are currently taking the course. **NOTE:** Classes can appear in more than one section, but the credits do not double count.The last section of the Upper\-Division requirements is the final breakdown of how you are meeting those requirements. An example is shown in the following image:These columns function the same ways as the first columns under the GPA and Credit Requirement section but will only count those courses that are used to fulfill the upper\-division credit requirement. |


**4\. Religion Requirements**




| (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| The religion requirement section is broken down into two parts, the **Cornerstone Requirement** and the **Eternal Truths Requirement**. We will go over the Cornerstone Requirement first in this article.**Cornerstone Requirement**BYU\-Idaho requires that specific religion courses be taken as part of your education at BYU\-Idaho. The required religion courses are:* REL 200C: The Eternal Family * REL 225C: Foundations of the Restoration * REL 250C: Jesus Christ and the Everlasting Gospel * REL 275C: Teachings of the Book of Mormon  This section will detail your progress toward this requirement.On the far left of the above image is a course status. The \*A indicates that this course is an absolute (required) course for you to take. The \*T indicates a course that you transferred in to meet the requirement. In the example above, the student took REL 200C and REL 225C as a student at BYU\-Idaho. However, they transferred in three other courses from a different institution to meet the other two cornerstone religion courses.**Eternal Truths**The Eternal Truths portion is where reading the religion requirements can become difficult. The recap of the completed credits in this section will show all of the religion credits that have been completed. If the courses from the Cornerstone Requirements are listed in this section as well, this recap will add the credits from the Cornerstone Requirement as well as the Eternal Truths requirement. In the image above, both REL 200C and REL 225C are listed in the Cornerstone Requirement as well as the Eternal Truths requirement. However, the credits will only count one time in the overall credit count. When you look recap of credit hours you have earned, it shows they completed 24 credit hours, however, that number is overstated by 4 credit hours because REL 200C and REL 225C were counted twice. **Please make sure to subtract any duplicate credits in this section in order to have a proper idea of the remaining religion requirement needed.** **NOTE:** Classes can appear in more than one section, but the credits do not double count.If certain types of degrees or a specific number of credits are transferred in, you may be awarded a religion waiver. Religion waivers are automatically placed and cannot be requested. You will see religion waivers as is detailed in the image above. You will also be able to recognize them because in the awarded grade spot, there will be a “W” – or “Waived.” The course code for the waiver also ends in “W”. Those two indicators – along with the course title – will let you know that the “W” shown in the grade means “Waived” and not a “W” that would usually indicate a withdrawal. |


  
**5\. General Education**




| (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| Following the Religion Requirement will be the General Education Requirement. A full image of this section is not provided because this can be a very long section. However, the principles discussed in previous sections about how the columns and courses are displayed will apply to this section.General Education Requirements are broken into the following categories:* Quantitative Reasoning * Writing * College Success * Breadth Courses 1 	+ Natural Science 	+ Arts \& Humanities 	+ Social Science * Breadth Courses 2 (Take an additional 6 credits from 2 of the breadth sections) 	+ Natural Science 	+ Arts \& Humanities 	+ Social Science  You are required to take 1 math course, 2 writing courses, 1 college success course, and 5 breadth courses. As an example, we will look at the Writing requirement to break down the information in the image below.**NOTE:** The information in this image can be applied to all categories within the General Education section of the Degree Audit. |
| The writing requirement contains 2 courses that need to be completed. A basic writing course and an advanced writing course. This is shown by the “AND” in the middle of the image above. As we learned in the Religion section, a \*T means the student has met this requirement with a transfer course. Listed next to that status is the course code that has been fulfilled at BYU\-Idaho for that requirement.The next two pieces of information are the course name and the course code that was transferred in from another institution. These are not course names or codes that are in the BYU\-Idaho course list. The semester this course was completed, the credits awarded, and the grade earned are shown next to the course code.Requirements that still need to be fulfilled would show the BYU\-Idaho course code in the second column with the title next to it. After the title would be an underscored line with no semester, credits, or grade awarded.In the breadth section, you may see multiple courses listed under a specific requirement. Not all of the listed courses are available to BYU\-Pathway students but listed on the Degree Audit because they are used for On\-Campus BYU\-Idaho students. BYU\-Pathway students should be referred to the Leadership and Self\-Reliance Certificate/Module as those are the courses that BYU\-Idaho has made available to BYU\-Pathway students. **The Leadership and Self\-Reliance Module**The Leadership and Self\-Reliance Module can be found in place of the Breadth Course section on the Degree Audit. Please note that not all students may have this section.Students may see the \*A symbol in front of a course in this section of the Degree Audit. This means that the course is an “Absolute course” and must be taken. However, exceptions to this include the following:* The Transfer Evaluation Office has applied a transfer course as a substitution * A BYU\-Idaho Breadth Course fulfills the requirement for the corresponding section * **\*\*\*Disclaimer: Due to specific course requirements being applied in the 2024 catalog year and later, known as the Three\-Year Degree, there are changes to transfer and residential courses being accepted as substitutions. See the following note:**  	+ **2023 Catalog Years and Prior:** The course list being accepted is the same, including the old Breadth Courses. 	+ **2024 Catalog Years/Three\-Year Degree Students:** Transfer courses and residential courses may be considered, **but there is no guarantee** they will be accepted as a substitution for a required course in the module. These residential courses include the old Breadth Courses. Again, these courses may be considered as substitutions for the course modules, but there is no guarantee.  In these cases, the Absolute course may still be showing, but then a course is placed beneath it. This means this Absolute course has an approved substitution that has been evaluated by the Transfer Evalutation Office. In the case of the image below, a transfer credit \*T was evaluated to fulfill the requirement for the \*A course in the first section, and then courses with no code listed below the \*A course are either residential substitutions or previous Breadth Course offerings. The last section only has one course listed because the student did complete the \*A course on the Leadership and Self Reliance Module, which is PUBH 132\. A minimum of 25 credit hours are required in the General Education section to fulfill graduation requirements. If you fulfill the General Education requirement completely with transfer courses but do not meet the minimum of 25 credit hours required, you will not meet the graduation requirement for the General Education section. Similarly, if you have not completed a minimum of 15 credit hours within the Breadth requirement, you will not meet the General Education Credit requirement. |


**6\. Degree Requirements**




| (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| Because this section is usually longer than the General Education Section, we will only look at a few images from this section. The information in the sections above about reading a Degree Audit can be applied to the Degree Requirements as well.This is a shortened version of an actual Degree Audit. Below the header of this section, it tells you that the student needs to complete “2 Introductory Certificates.” Since this student has completed two introductory certificates already, that portion of the requirement is completed and no other certificate options will be seen here. If the student had not yet completed 2 introductory certificates, all of the available certificate options for this section would be seen.The next section, “Advanced Certificate” explains that the student must complete 1 certificate from a list of options. The only option provided in the image is the certificate the student is pursuing in order to show what an incomplete course requirement looks like on a Degree Audit. Notice the “IP” in the grade spot for the courses CSE 340 and CSE 341\. This shows the courses are currently “In Progress.” The underscored line to the right of the course CSE 325 shows that the course has not yet been attempted and that it will need to be taken in order to fulfill the requirement.The final requirement in this section is the “Internship”. In the above image, the student has not completed this requirement and so the Degree Audit shows all the available options that can be used to complete the requirement (based on the options for an On\-Campus student). Not all of these options will be available to students through BYU\-Pathway Worldwide. |

   
**7\. Other Courses Taken**


| (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| The final section shows any elective courses a student has either completed through BYU\-Idaho or courses transferred from a different institution that do not fill any of the other graduation requirements. These courses will be included in the overall credit count listed at the top of the Degree Audit.Because there is not a specific requirement for elective credit, and elective credit is only used to help the student meet the 120\-credit hour requirement, there is no requirement indicated in the “Other Courses Taken” section. However, the legend at the bottom will explain the abbreviations used throughout the Degree Audit and will help you understand how some courses have been fulfilled. There are two more not listed in the image that are important to be aware of:* IPR (In\-Progress Retake) * WV (Waived) |
