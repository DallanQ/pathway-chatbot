# How To Issue An EC3 Certificate

## Englishconnect 3

### Overview

There are two Englishconnect 3 certificates:

1. Participation Certificate (given by the missionary)
2. Completion Certificate (given by the Englishconnect home office)

Englishconnect is not certified and does not award university credit. Certificates are a celebration of the learner's progress and hard work. Earning a certificate represents a learner's preparation for Pathwayconnect. Learners who earn a certificate of completion do not need to take the English Language Assessment (ELA) when applying for Pathwayconnect.

## Englishconnect Completion Requirements

To earn a certificate of completion, the learner must:

- Pass the Level 4 test for reading, writing, grammar, and vocabulary
- Pass the Level 3 test for listening and speaking

Completion Certificates are awarded by the Englishconnect home office. No further action on the part of the missionary is required.

## Participation Certificates

You can give a participation certificate to each learner who has consistently attended the conversation groups at the conclusion of an Englishconnect 3 term.
