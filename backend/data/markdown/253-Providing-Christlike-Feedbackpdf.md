## Providing Christlike Feedback

You can help your students develop and grow academically and spiritually by occasionally giving Christlike feedback about their participation in the gathering. Giving helpful feedback can be challenging. Feedback should be focused on lifting the student. Be sensitive to the Spirit so that you may be directed about what to say.

### Helping Students Develop And Grow

## Providing Christlike Feedback

In general, feedback is better received when it is focused on the behavior and not the student. Below are four guidelines that can assist you when providing impactful feedback to your students.

- Be direct when providing feedback.
- Identify specific behavior that positively impacted the group or another student.
- Describe the outcome that the student's behavior had—the positive experience or consequences it generated for you or others.
- Beware to not describe the student. Instead, describe what he or she did and the impact it had on the group or another student.

### Providing Christlike Feedback

**EXAMPLE**
Low impact feedback: "You are so good with numbers. Your comment was exceptional again today."

High impact feedback: "When I hear you speak in the group, I see that your comments help clarify concepts for other students and help them understand what is going on."

## Providing Christlike Feedback

Love is the primary motivator when Providing Christlike feedback. The manual Teaching in the Savior's Way teaches us five principles to help us love those we serve. See Part 2: Principles of Christlike Teaching for more information.

- See learners the way God sees them.
- Seek to know them – understand their circumstances, needs, and strengths.
- Pray for them by name.
- Create a safe environment where all are respected and know their contributions are valued.
- Find appropriate ways to express your love.
