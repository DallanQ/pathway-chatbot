# Autodrop Information

## Englishconnect 3

- Non-participating learners will be dropped from Englishconnect 3 on a specified day around 5 weeks into the term.
- Englishconnect3 autodrop date will be on the Tuesday of Week 5 for each term (typically Day 35). Reminders for this deadline will be announced in the EC3 Missionary Update email.

Learners will not be able to re-enroll for the current term but can apply/continue the program for a future term.

- Non-participation is defined as not completing at least one unit in the Proficiency Practice section during the evaluation window.

## Evaluation Window

An evaluation window is the timeframe when Englishconnect looks at learner activity to decide if they are participating or not.

Learners are considered as non-participating and are auto dropped if they have not completed at least one unit sometime within weeks 1â€“4 of the term.

This can be in any skill area. They will remain enrolled if they have completed at least one unit.

The term autodrop is the process where Englishconnect examines learner activity in Englishconnect 3 to determine whether to unenroll them.

Unenrolling, or auto dropping learners who do not participate is intended to help them.

Non-participating learners are not likely to withdraw themselves and will go on to accumulate tuition charges unless they are unenrolled automatically.

One reason for auto-drop is to help learners commit.

The second is to avoid any charges from their account. They can reapply in the future without having to pay for something they did not use.

## What Happens After Autodrop?

Auto dropped learners will receive a full refund. The charges will be waived for that term if a student has not paid.

Learners will lose access to the Englishconnect web app and activities once they are auto-dropped.
