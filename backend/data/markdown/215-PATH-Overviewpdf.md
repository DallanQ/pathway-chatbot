# Path Overview Path For Pathwayconnect

BYU-Pathway manages all student records in a student information system called PATH. Student records are to be kept confidential.

You are given access to PATH by your new missionary orientation trainer. Email missionary-pw@byupathway.org if you cannot access your account.

## What can you see in PATH to minister to students?
- A list of the students assigned to your gathering group.
- Courses taken by each student.
- A student's current grade in a course.
- The last time a student logged into their online course.
- The total time a student has spent in their course.
- Next term's registration for a student.

## Student Lists

PATH allows you to print an alphabetical PDF list of the students in your group. This is helpful as you meet students before your first gathering and learn their names. PATH also provides student emails along with your student list so that you can email all students at once.

## Missionary Information

Each gathering group in PATH has the assigned missionary's name and Zoom link for virtual gatherings.

## Searching Path

The search feature in PATH can be used to search students and missionaries by name, ID number, email, or other information. You can also search by stake name to find PATH students past and present within a ward or stake.

BYU-Pathway Worldwide considers maintaining the security and confidentiality of student information and academic records a high priority.

You are granted access to private information and are required to complete FERPA training to ensure the protection of student information.

FERPA training is found in your new missionary orientation or on the Missionary Services website.
