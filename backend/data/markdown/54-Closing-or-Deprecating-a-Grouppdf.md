# Closing/Deprecating a Group PATH for Pathwayconnect

**Note:** This task can only be performed by individuals in the following roles: Area Coordination Missionary and Area Manager.

**Tips:**
- It may be helpful to have the unassigned list in the location empty when deprecating groups.
- It may also be helpful to have the PDF of the group being deprecated open in another tab, or to have a printed list of students being dropped from the group.
- The unassigned list should be checked to see if students who are no longer enrolled in a group have fallen into the unassigned list. If they have, they should be moved to a holding group.

## Deprecating Gathering Groups
After a group has completed their three terms, we want to remove (deprecate) that gathering group from the groups list based on the following schedule.

**How to determine when to deprecate groups:**
- When deprecating a Fall start term, wait until after the first day of class of the following Spring term.
- When deprecating a Winter start term, wait until after the first day of class of the following Fall term.
- When deprecating a Spring start term, wait until after the first day of class of the following Winter term.
