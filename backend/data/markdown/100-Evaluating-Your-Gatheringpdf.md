# Evaluating Your Gathering Shepherding

## Evaluating Your Gathering

The gathering is an essential component of Pathwayconnect courses. You have the opportunity to create an environment at the gatherings that allows students to have life-changing experiences.

Review the questions in this training. Identify two areas you are doing well and two you want to improve.

## Before The Gathering

### Establishing a spiritual setting

- Do you wear missionary attire and name badges?
- Do you arrive early, ensuring the building is open and the classroom is organized or that your Zoom room is open?
- Is the classroom organized to make sure the students have good workspace, tables, chairs, and elbow room?
- Did you arrange for hymns and prayers?
- Do you assist the lead student with set-up as needed?
- Do you greet students by name at the door or as they arrive virtually?
- Does the gathering begin on time?
