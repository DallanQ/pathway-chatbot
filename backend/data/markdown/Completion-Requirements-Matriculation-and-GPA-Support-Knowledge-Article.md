**1\. Certificate of Completion and Course Requirements**


| **Information** |
| --- |
| You must have ALL of the following to receive your PathwayConnect Certificate of Completion: * No outstanding debt or financial holds * 2\.0 cumulative GPA or higher (Note: cumulative GPA includes all attempted courses; excluding institute courses. If a student retakes a course or its equivalent, the lowest score received will be excluded from the cumulative GPA.)\* * Minimum Grade of at least D\- in ALL courses.\* * Must complete Introductory Certificate Course with a D\- or higher\* 	+ \*\*Note: the Introductory Certificate Course is the beginning of your official transcript (academic record) at BYU\-Idaho or Ensign. This grade will be on your Online Certificates and Degree transcript permanently.  For Example: You completed PCB/PCIB 101 and PCB/PCIB 102 with an A grade. Then completed PCB/PCIB 103 with an F grade but finished your Introductory Certificate Course with a B grade. You would not have completed the PathwayConnect program, even though you met the GPA requirement. You would need to retake PCB/PCIB 103 and earn at least a D\- to qualify for their Certificate of Completion.    \*Must have a 3\.0 GPA in PCB/PCIB 101, 102, and 103 to apply to the Online Certificates and Degrees Program.    Course Requirements * Current Program 	+ PCB/PCIB 101, PCB/PCIB 102, PCB/PCIB 3 and Introductory Certificate Course 	+ Note: Previous equivalent courses may be substituted for currently offered courses   If the student attended PathwayConnect prior to 2022, they may have completed courses that are equivalent to the new courses offered: * Attended PathwayConnect 2019\-2022 	+ PC 101/PC 101(L) would replace PCB/PCIB 101 	+ PC 102/PC 102(L) would replace PCB/PCIB 102 	+ PC 103/PC 103(L) would replace PCB/PCIB 103 * Attended PathwayConnect 2014\-2019 	+ GS 120(L) would replace PCB/PCIB 101 	+ MAT 100(L) would replace PCB/PCIB 102 	+ ENG 106(L) would replace PCB/PCIB 102 |


**2\. GPA**


| **Information** |
| --- |
| Grade Point Average (GPA)  Academic performance in PathwayConnect is evaluated using a student’s grade point average (GPA). GPAs are calculated based on the grade you earn, and how many credits a course has. Grades are determined by a letter. In addition to earning a letter you can receive a \+ or \-, this will affect how many points you are given.    Here the following courses and their credits:  * PCB/PCIB 101 (3 Credits) * PCB/PCIB 102 (3 Credits) * PCB/PCIB 103 (1 Credit) \+ Introductory Certificate (1\-3 Credits, depending on the course)    Example: PCB/PCIB 103 is worth 1 credit, whereas PCB/PCIB 101 is worth 3 credits. PCB/PCIB 101 will impact your GPA more than PCB/PCIB 103 will.    Your GPA is calculated in two different ways:  * Cumulative GPA  The cumulative GPA is calculated using all courses you have attempted during your PathwayConnect experience (excluding Institute courses). You are required to have a 2\.0 or higher cumulative GPA to complete PathwayConnect (See [PC \- Certificates of Completion](https://pathway-missionary.powerappsportals.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01155/en-us)).  * Program GPA  The program GPA is calculated using the core PathwayConnect courses (i.e. PCB/PCIB 101, PCB/PCIB 102, PCB/PCIB 103\). The introductory certificate courses, and Institute courses are not factored into the program GPA. You, being a PathwayConnect student, must have a program GPA of 3\.0 in order to qualify for matriculation into the BYU\-Idaho Online Degree Program (see[OD \- Admission Requirements](https://pathway-missionary.powerappsportals.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01524/en-us)[)](https://pathway-missionary.powerappsportals.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01524/en-us).    Grading Scale and Grade Points given for grade:  Grade Received (Grade Points Per Credits) * A (x4\.0\) * A\- (x3\.7\) * B\+ (x3\.4\) * B (x3\.0\) * B\- (x2\.7\) * C\+ (x2\.4\) * C (x2\.0\) * C\- (x1\.7\) * D\+ (x1\.4\) * D (x1\.0\) * D\- (x0\.7\) * F or E\* (x0\.0\) * UW (x0\.0\)     \*Ensign College uses an E Using the above information, you can calculate your own cumulative or program GPA using the [BYU\- Idaho GPA Calculator](https://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/calculate-gpa).    How to use the GPA Calculator  View Tutorial: [How to use the GPA Calculator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eV7oA4BQflKBPNuDVLrHFHdV3d8HCcbg/view?usp=sharing)     How Does a PathwayConnect GPA Affect the GPA at Partner Schools?  Once matriculated into an online program, your PathwayConnect courses, including Introductory Certificate Courses, will not factor into your GPA at our partner schools. Grades earned from local Institutes of Religion will also not be factored into the GPA at our partner schools. (See [PC \- Institute](https://pathway-missionary.powerappsportals.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01813/en-us))    Retaking Courses  You can retake courses if you wish to improve your overall GPA. If you retake a course(s), only the higher grade will be factored into the GPA calculation (See [PC \- Course Retakes](https://pathway-missionary.powerappsportals.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01173/en-us)). |
