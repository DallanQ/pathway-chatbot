## Who is this article for?
Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, Zone Leaders, and Area Coordination Missionaries

**Purpose:**
This article defines the criteria, purpose, and timing of auto-drop so that you can explain auto-drop to your students.

## Explain Auto-Drop To Students

Please inform your students that anyone who is non-participating will be dropped from Pathwayconnect on Tuesday of Week 3.

Explain to students that they cannot re-enroll for the current term but can apply for the next term if they are auto-dropped.

Non-participation is defined as not submitting any assignments during Weeks 1 or 2.

**What is auto-drop?**
Auto-drop is the process to determine whether to unenroll a student who is not participating in their course. This is intended to help. These students are not likely to withdraw themselves and may earn a failing grade on their transcript and a tuition charge, unless they are unenrolled.

## Evaluation Window

An evaluation window is the timeframe when BYU-Pathway looks at student activity to decide if they are participating or not. Students are considered as non-participating and are auto-dropped if they do not turn in any graded quizzes or assignments during the evaluation window.

**Evaluation Window:**
- Week 1: Th, F, Sa, Su, M, Tu, W
- Week 2: Th, F, Sa

# Su M

## Week 3

What happens after auto-drop?

- Auto-dropped students will not receive a grade or a 'W' on their transcript.
- Auto-dropped students will receive a full refund. If a student has not paid, the charges will be excused for that term.
