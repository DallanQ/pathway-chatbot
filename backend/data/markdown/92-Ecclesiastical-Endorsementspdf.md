## Updates To Student Ecclesiastical Endorsements

- The ecclesiastical endorsement was updated to provide consistency across the Church Educational System (CES).
- The endorsement process is handled by ecclesiastical leaders and a central office, the Endorsement Clearing office (ECO). Schools such as BYU-Idaho and Ensign College cannot see into the endorsement application.
- Interview questions have been updated to focus on a student's effort to grow spiritually. Students who are of another faith are asked different questions than those who are members. In general, the questions for nonmembers ask if the student will obey the Word of Wisdom, law of chastity, be honest, and support Church teachings.
- Additional details on these updates can be found in the Church newsroom.

## Ecclesiastical Endorsement FAQ

**WHAT IS A STUDENT'S ENDORSEMENT STATUS?**

- Members of the Church will need to speak with their bishop to find out the status of their endorsement.
- Those who are not members but met with a Latter-day Saint bishop for their endorsement will need to speak with that bishop to find out their endorsement status.
- Those who are not members and met with an ecclesiastical leader of their faith will need to contact that ecclesiastical leader to verify they have sent in the form. If the student has confirmed that they sent in the form, they can send in an inquiry to BYU-Pathway through their mentor. BYU-Pathway will contact the Ecclesiastical Clearance Office (ECO) for details. This inquiry may take a few days to complete.
- Students, parents, and missionaries should not contact the ECO. Only priesthood leaders or a CES institution should contact the ECO.

## Member Endorsement

**WHAT IF THE WRONG CHURCH UNIT IS DISPLAYED ON A STUDENT ENDORSEMENT? HOW IS THAT FIXED?**

- The unit displayed in the endorsement

**IF A BISHOP DOES NOT SEE A STUDENT LISTED IN HIS QUEUE, WHAT SHOULD A STUDENT DO?**

- Make sure the student's records are in the bishop's unit.
- If the student's records are in the unit and their bishop still cannot see their request, their bishop will need to contact the Ecclesiastical Clearance Office. Contact information for the ECO is in the endorsement system (found in Leader & Clerk Resources).

## WHAT IF THE STUDENT APPLIES TO MULTIPLE CES SCHOOLS?

- The priesthood leader will only be able to see one.
- The endorsement will link to all applications.

## WHAT IF A STUDENT APPLICATION DOES NOT SHOW COMPLETE, BUT THE BISHOP INFORMATION SHOWS COMPLETE?

- This usually means the student needs to interview with a stake leader.

## WHERE ARE ENDORSEMENT FORMS FOR NON-LATTER-DAY SAINT LEADERS SENT?

- Students download the endorsement form for non-Latter-Day Saint leaders in the application. Forms are sent by the non-Latter-Day Saint leader to the Ecclesiastical Clearance Office. Instructions are found on the form itself.

## HOW DOES A STUDENT CHANGE FROM A CONTINUING ENDORSEMENT TO AN APPLICANT ENDORSEMENT?

The student will need to submit a new request for an endorsement. In most cases, applicant endorsements are requested as part of the admissions application.

## HOW CAN A STUDENT ASSIST AN ECCLESIASTICAL LEADER WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ENDORSEMENT PROCESS?

A student can suggest to a leader to log in to the Church's endorsement system through Leader & Clerk Resources. Inside the endorsement system will be the contact information for the Ecclesiastical Clearance Office. All questions should go to the ECO.
