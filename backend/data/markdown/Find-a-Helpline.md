### What are helplines?

Helplines (also known as hotlines or crisis lines) provide immediate crisis counseling, emotional support and information – for free.

Most helpline phone numbers are toll\-free and many helplines are available over text message or online chat. Helplines are often available 24/7, so you can contact them at any time of the day or night.

### How will a helpline support me?

Helplines provide a judgment\-free space for you to talk through difficult emotions and experiences, receive support, and connect to other resources that can help you.

Talking helps, and research has shown that people feel less distressed after contacting helplines.

### What can I talk to a helpline about?

The most common types of helpline are [suicide prevention hotlines](/topics/suicidal-thoughts), [domestic violence hotlines](/topics/abuse-domestic-violence) and [sexual assault hotlines](/topics/sexual-abuse).

However, helplines are available for a wide range of mental health and emotional struggles including [anxiety](/topics/anxiety), [depression](/topics/depression), [gender or sexual identity](/topics/gender-sexual-identity), [substance use](/topics/substance-use) and much more.

You don't have to be suicidal or in a severe situation to contact a helpline. You might just need to talk, or want information on [supporting others](/topics/supporting-others).

### How do I find the best helpline for me?

In some countries, many helplines are available. For example, if you live in the United States, popular nationwide helplines are the [988 Suicide \& Crisis Lifeline](/organizations/988-suicide-crisis-lifeline), [Crisis Text Line](/organizations/crisis-text-line) and [TrevorLifeline](/organizations/trevorlifeline).

When you search for a helpline on Find A Helpline, our intelligent ranking algorithm will recommend the best helplines for you.

You can also further filter according to your needs, and read helpline descriptions to learn more about the service each helpline provides.

Because helplines are free, you can contact more than one service to find the right one for you.

----------------------------------------

Unsure if contacting a helpline is right for you? Here are some reasons other people have sought free, confidential support from a helpline or hotline:

* Experiencing a suicidal crisis, such as thinking “I want to die” or about how to kill yourself, or wanting support after attempting to take your life.
* Experiencing domestic abuse or violence, sexual abuse, depression, anxiety, or other emotional distress.
* Struggling with self\-harm, an addiction or substance use challenge, your body image or an eating disorder.
* Noticing warning signs in a loved one, feeling concerned someone may be at risk of hurting themselves, or wanting to know how to help someone you’re worried about.
* Wanting to learn about mental health crisis services, suicide prevention, general mental health services and resources.
* Just simply thinking “I need help” and not knowing where to start.
