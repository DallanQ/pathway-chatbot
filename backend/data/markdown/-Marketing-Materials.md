11\.5 Marketing Materials
=========================




---






BYU\-Pathway Worldwide provides a variety of marketing materials to assist in the finding and outreach efforts of missionaries and local leaders. Only materials created by BYU\-Pathway are approved for use. Missionaries, priesthood leaders, and others may not create their own materials. Doing so would constitute copyright infringement or may be in violation of local laws and regulations. Using copyrighted materials (including logos, slogans, images, etc.) without authorization from the copyright owner is contrary to Church policy and may also subject the Church or the user to legal liability. (Note: Active promotional efforts may not be permitted in some areas. Contact your BYU\-Pathway area manager with questions.)



Following is a list of available marketing materials. All materials, including instructions on how to use them, may be found in [BYU\-Pathway’s marketing materials pages](http://marketing.pathwaysupport.org/).
