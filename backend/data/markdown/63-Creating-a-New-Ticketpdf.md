# Creating A New Ticket Crm

## Click New Ticket In The Left-Hand Menu.

- Search for the student by name, email, or ID. Select the student from the list.

- If there are two options for a student, be sure to choose the name with a ticket icon (jigsaw shaped).

> Note: If you cannot find a student, try the following:
> - Copy the student's ID # from PATH. This is the most reliable.
> - Check again in PATH that the student's name is spelled correctly.
> - Check enrollment again (Students need to be enrolled, not just admitted to create a ticket in CRM).
> - Check if students have duplicate accounts.
