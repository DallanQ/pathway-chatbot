# Purpose
This training is designed to help you as a service missionary understand the different programs of BYU-Pathway Worldwide, including who should start in Pathwayconnect versus Certificates & Degrees. This information will empower you to identify and invite those who would be the right fit. This training should not exceed 30 minutes.

## BYU-Pathway Worldwide
BYU-Pathway Worldwide is a program designed to serve the "hidden many." Who are the hidden many? President Clark G. Gilbert has stated: "Many of us know someone...whose life situation would improve by receiving additional education, but because of financial reasons or a lack of confidence, they remain stuck where they are. More than half of Church members in the United States and Canada do not have a college degree, and we estimate that number jumps to more than 85 percent for the international Church. We often refer to this group as 'the hidden many.'" Per President Gilbert, the hidden many include those who have not completed their degree due to life constraints. This group consists of those who have never started college and those who started but have not completed.

> Discuss: Who are the hidden many? Raise your hand if you know someone who wants to go back to school. Who do you know that could benefit from additional education?

## Starting Points
BYU-Pathway Worldwide offers two starting points for potential students: Pathwayconnect and Certificates & Degrees. Around 90-95% of potential domestic students and nearly 100% of international students should begin with Pathwayconnect. However, many individuals, especially those with previous university credits, can be confused if Pathwayconnect is the right place for them to re-start their degree. Recent surveys indicate this confusion prevents them from enrolling in any BYU-Pathway program. As you speak to these individuals, please keep the following in mind:

- Pathwayconnect is not a remedial program, intended to correct or improve deficient skills; it is a university-level curriculum.
- For most students, all Pathwayconnect credits count and apply to Certificates & Degrees, and most credits are required.
- For most students, Pathwayconnect does not add more time to degree completion.
- Even among mature students, Pathwayconnect completers experience greater confidence and a higher GPA when they matriculate. 94% would recommend it to a friend.
- Previous credits completed from accredited colleges and universities will generally apply to the degree students pursue, even if they begin with Pathwayconnect.
- Pathwayconnect students pay 40% less for their degree, translating into thousands of dollars of savings.

There are some exceptions when a potential student would be better suited to skip Pathwayconnect and start with Certificates & Degrees. This situation applies to only 5-10% of applicants. These generally include one or more of the following:

- They want a certificate only and do not plan to pursue a degree.

**Pathwayconnect and Direct Entry into Certificate and Degree Programs**

- This situation often applies to those who already have a degree and want to obtain a new skill (e.g., web design, accounting, etc.).
- They have previously taken more than 60-70 U.S. university credits.
- Generally, students with more credits than this cannot apply PC101 and PC102 credits toward their degree, as their elective requirements have already been fulfilled.
- Nevertheless, many students in this situation may still choose to start through Pathwayconnect due to the reduced tuition.
- Have the ability and desire to attend full-time right away.
- Pathwayconnect is designed to be part-time for the first year, but matriculated students can attend full-time after that.

**Reasons for Skipping Pathwayconnect**

Discuss In your opinion, which of these three is the most common reasons why many are skipping Pathwayconnect and going directly into the Certificate and degree program?

Watch Brother Doug Willden, North America West Manager, will explain how a bachelor's degree is composed, including how Pathwayconnect credits fit within the framework of a degree through BYU-Pathway Worldwide.

## Practice Answer Key
Below are answers to the practice on pages 3 and 4.

1. **Pathwayconnect**: Karla will gain confidence and skills to help her choose a career path. The program is also flexible with her job schedule. She will also get reduced tuition for completing Pathwayconnect. All Pathwayconnect credits will count towards her degree.

2. **Certificates & Degrees**: It is more cost-effective for Jessica. She will also get her certificate faster.

# Pathwayconnect

- Bradley's transfer credits are under 60 credits. His transfer credits along with his Pathwayconnect credits, will help him toward his associate degree. Since he is not a member, Pathway connect will help prepare him for the requirements for the ecclesiastical endorsement.

# Certificates & Degrees

- Only $500 difference for cost of a degree, but Pathwayconnect would add 8 months in Julio's case, which is a priority.

# None of the above

- BYU-Pathway does not offer a nursing license

# Pathwayconnect

- Low transfer credits and Pathwayconnect supports Catherine's goal

## Of Spiritual Development.

# Nearly equal choice

- While all 80 credits may not transfer, money is tight; it is a ~$1,000 less through Pathwayconnect but could add more time to the degree

# Pathwayconnect

- It would save money even though Cheryl already knows which degree she wants

# Pathwayconnect

- Since Jeremy is less-active, he may not qualify for an ecclesiastical endorsement right away. In relation to his degree choice, although we don't offer a bachelor's in accounting, BYU-Pathway does offer a business degree with a certificate in accounting. Since he is not 100% sure, Pathwayconnect can help him solidify his path; it can also strengthen his spirituality

# Pathwayconnect

- As it is likely all 60 credits will transfer over to the degree program, Tyrone will pay ~$3,000 more if he began with certificates and degrees.
