# Pc Late Payment Fee Policy

If students do not pay their full tuition by the last day of the semester, they will be assessed a 5 percent late fee on their remaining balance. Students will not be able to register for any future semesters until the debt is paid in its entirety. Students in their final semester should be paid in full before submitting an application to the Online Degree Program. Those who fail to pay will not be eligible for matriculation to any BYU-Idaho or Ensign College program and will not receive a Pathwayconnect completion certificate.
