### Heber J. Grant Tuition Discount

BYU\-Pathway students are eligible to receive a [tuition discount](https://www.byupathway.org/hjg-scholarship) of 10, 25, or 50% off their tuition balance. (The discount amount varies based on a student's needs and enrollment status.)   
  
After enrolling, students must complete an interactive lesson in their [student portal](https://path.byupathway.org/portal/home/hjgscholarship) to receive the discount.   
  
Students enrolling in an online degree program will need to (1\) apply at the beginning of their program *and* (2\) be registered for courses at least three days before the start of each semester. Students must reapply every two years to keep the discount.












### Returned Missionary Scholarship

Any student who has returned from a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\-day Saints during the past 60 months is eligible for a [25% tuition discount](https://www.byupathway.edu/scholarship25). (This includes missionaries who did not complete their entire mission.) Returned missionaries must also be registered for courses at least three days before the start of each semester.












### Needs\-based Scholarship

Students can work with an assigned [mentor](https://www.byupathway.edu/mentors), who will help determine if the student is eligible for a needs\-based scholarship. (This scholarship is limited to one term during the first year of enrollment.)  
  
### Reduced Tuition

The price of tuition for students who start their degree through BYU\-Pathway Worldwide’s [preferred path](https://www.byupathway.edu/admissions/application-process#preferred-path) (PathwayConnect) is significantly reduced — and you keep the lower cost for your entire degree program!
