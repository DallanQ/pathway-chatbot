**3\. Requesting Transcripts**


| **Information** |

| Both official and unofficial transcripts you can request through your student portal. (See "Request Transcripts Process" below.) You are not charged for transcripts you order through BYU\-Pathway Worldwide.  What is an Unofficial Transcript?Unofficial transcripts may be provided for your reference. However, unofficial transcripts do not represent your official academic record. Unofficial transcripts are provided as downloadable/printable PDF documents and are available immediately upon request. Physical copies of unofficial transcripts cannot be sent via mail. Generally, these are not used when applying or transferring to other universities or college programs. These do not use the college seal.What is an Official Transcripts?  Generally, official transcripts may take up to 2 weeks to be processed and sent, but there is no guaranteed time frame in which transcripts will be processed. Once requested, official transcripts will only be sent via mail; you cannot request they be sent via email or any other electronic means. These are sent using official letterhead paper and contain the seal of the university. Once the transcripts are mailed, it can take up to 2 months (or more) for the receiving institution to receive and input the transcripts. We have no power over transcripts once we have mailed them. You must contact the receiving institution for any other concerns about your official transcript. Official transcripts should be sent directly to the receiving institution. If an official transcript is sent to you and you plan on delivering it yourself, it will no longer be official if it is opened.    Note: The introductory Certificate Course is the beginning of your official transcript (academic record) at BYU\-Idaho or Ensign College.
