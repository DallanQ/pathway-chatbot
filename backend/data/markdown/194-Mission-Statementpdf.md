# Mission Statement Byu-Pathway Worldwide

BYU-Pathway Worldwide was founded and is supported and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Its mission is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities.

The organization does this by:

1. Helping students get the gospel down into their hearts,
2. Helping them become capable learners, and
3. Preparing them to lead and support families.

BYU-Pathway Worldwide is designed to provide access to higher education wherever the Church is organized. BYU-Pathway starts by preparing students through life-skills development and English-language learning. It also provides access to appropriate certificate and degree programs by coordinating and leveraging curriculum from across the Church Educational System.
