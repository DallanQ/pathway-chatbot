While BYU\-Pathway is not legally required to provide access and accommodations to EnglishConnect, PathwayConnect, or Institute students with disabilities, it endeavors to provide reasonable assistance to students who need it. Such assistance is provided voluntarily and at BYU\-Pathway's sole discretion, and may be different from accommodations provided by other institutions. Here are a few resources for students with disabilities:

* [Ensign College Disability Resources](https://www.ensign.edu/resources)
* [BYU\-Idaho Accessibility Resources](https://www.byui.edu/accessibility-services/)
