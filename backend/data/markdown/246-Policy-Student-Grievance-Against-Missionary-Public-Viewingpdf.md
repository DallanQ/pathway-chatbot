# Policy: Student Grievance Against Missionary Public Viewing
**Approval Date:** January 27, 2021

When a student has a complaint or concern regarding a missionary, the student is to complete the Missionary Grievance form with their
1. student name,
2. student ID,
3. the missionary's name,
4. a detailed summary of the complaint, and
5. any attempts the student made to resolve the issue.

The form will notify Missionary Support.

## Missionary Support Process
Missionary Support will work with the associated area manager to resolve the issue. The area manager or Area Coordination Missionary (ACM) will work with the student to ensure the issue is resolved.

Creating a positive, uplifting, and spiritual environment for each student and missionary is of great importance. Grievances and complaints are taken seriously, and students and missionaries should be reminded that each complaint will be held in confidence.
