# Helping Students Register For Next Term Shepherding

## How You Can Support The Student

Pathwayconnect does not automatically register students for their next course. The break between terms can be dangerous. Students may put off or forget to register. There are students who may need to withdraw due to personal issues. Others need encouragement to continue.

Consider making a list of students who might be wavering. Contact them to determine the reason for their indecision.

- Remind them of their long-term goal for a certificate or degree. Show them how far they have come. They will reach their goal if they take it a step at a time.
- Follow up on any commitment they make.
- For Technical issues have them contact their Mentor or BYU- Pathway Support.
- For Financial problems they should contact their Mentor, family, or local Church leaders.

## Let the Spirit Guide You

- Let the Spirit guide you as you observe the student and talk to them. Ask the student to pray about their decision.
- Remind the student of their successes and the hurdles they have overcome. Consider sharing Elder Gilbert's inspiring talk, "From Grit to Grace".
- Look at the content for the next term's class. Ask about their concerns. Review content that will help them such as the course previews.
- Encourage the students to get help from online instructors, peer mentors, and fellow students.

## How Students Register For The Next Term

- Students log in to the BYU-Pathway Portal to register. A pop-up menu asks them if they want to register at that time.
- If the student responds "no," then a reminder is placed on their personal To-Do list.

## In The Student Portal Click Register For Courses

A survey may pop up about the student's job or job needs. Answer the questions and click Submit. The student will next be taken to the enrollment screen.

Review the course selection and tuition cost. Click Enroll. The system may take several minutes to enroll the student.

After enrollment confirmation, close the notification menu. Students confirm their future course enrollment in the Courses menu on the right side of the student portal.

# Faqs About Continuing Registration:

- **Some students have low grades. Can they still register for the next term?**
- Yes! They can still register for the next term, even if they have a C, D, or F grade.
- It would be in their best interest to repeat the course if their grade is C- or lower (see How Students Repeat Courses to Improve Their GPA).

- **How do students register for classes?**
- Students sign in to byupathway.org and follow the instructions in the student portal. If they need help, they should contact their peer mentor.

- **Students haven't paid their current term's tuition yet. Can they register for the next term?**
- Tuition for the current term should be paid in full before registration for the next term. A student in financial need may request an exception allowing them to register using the Exception Request Form. Their tuition balance will then be rolled into the next term.
