# Student Issue Escalation Process Crm

## Student Issue Escalation Process

### Area Managers And ACMS

The Student Success team has approved an escalation process for student issues regarding enrollment, finance, applications, and matriculation. This process is for area managers and ACMs. A simplified version of this process will be available for gathering missionaries on the Missionary Services website.

1. A student should first work with their mentor to resolve any issues regarding enrollment, finance, applications, or matriculation.

2. A student should submit the Mentor Concern Form if he or she is not receiving the help needed.

3. A student without an assigned mentor can schedule a time with an enrollment counselor. Scheduling can be done through the chatbot in the student portal.

4. A student not receiving the help needed by an enrollment counselor should submit their concern through the Enrollment Counselor Concern Form.

5. The area manager or ACM should submit a CRM ticket if a student issue is not resolved in two business days from the time the student reported their concern to the mentor or enrollment counselor.

6. Area managers and ACMs should submit the Student Escalation Form if their submitted CRM ticket is not resolved within two business days.

7. Issues reported to the Student Escalation Form not resolved in two business days should be emailed directly to Travis Yost at tyost@byupathway.org. ACMs need to consult with the area manager prior to emailing Travis.

## Addition Tips

It is important to describe the student case in detail. This is critical when troubleshooting a technical error. Screenshots when possible are recommended.

- ACMs can consult with area managers with questions regarding this process.
- Please contact Missionary Support (missionary-pw@byupathway.org) with questions as you assist the missionaries in your area.
