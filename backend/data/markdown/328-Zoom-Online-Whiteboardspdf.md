You will most often use the option Collaborating. The bottom checkbox allows students to see the whiteboard after the meeting.

Choose between presentation (create slideshows in the whiteboard), a timer, or laser pointer.

Experiment with the toolbar. Create shapes, lines, text, upload content, etc.

These are examples of some of the options in your tools. Take time to explore your options.

**TIPS:**

- The online whiteboard automatically saves each screen you create. You can return to your screens when you open a meeting and click on Whiteboard in the toolbar.
