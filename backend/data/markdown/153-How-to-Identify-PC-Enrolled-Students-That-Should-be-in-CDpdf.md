# How to Identify PC Enrolled Students that Should Be in Certificates & Degrees

## PATH for Pathwayconnect

Notice this student's number is an older one.

Now let's click the RECORDS tab.

### Scroll Down To The Bottom Of The Records Page.

Notice the three courses the student has taken (GS 120, MATH 100G, and ENG 106).
Note the grades and the credit hours he received for each. Let's check his GPA
using the GPA Calculator.

Our student received an A in GS 120 and an A in MATH 100G, both were 3 credit
hour courses. Added together that is 6 credit hours. Enter 6 in the A, Quality
Credits box.

Our student also received a C- in ENG 106 which was a 3- credit hour course.
Enter 3 in the C-, QUALITY CREDITS box.

6 credit hours with A and 3 credit hours with C-, the GPA is 3.233.

You can go to the GPA CALCULATOR to try it for yourself.

## Eligibility

Students must complete one of the combinations of academic courses as listed in
the knowledge base article KA-01524 on requirements for PC Students to be
eligible for admissions to the Online Certificates and Degrees program, receive
ongoing tuition benefits, and have the TOEFL requirement waived.

If the academic requirements have been met, and the student is incorrectly
enrolled in one of the PC courses, it is important that the student withdraw
from PC, so that no tuition charges are showing. The student will not be able to
enroll in courses at BYU Idaho or Ensign College if tuition is owed.

## Student Actions

When you identify that a student is eligible for Certificates and Degrees, the
student should:
- Withdraw from Pathway Connect (so charges do not show owing).
- Be Notified. Have their options clearly explained to them.
- Submit their Application to Certificates and Degrees, if that is their desire.

## Additional Helps

Let's do some research on this student. Click the ENROLLMENT tab.

Here, you see the future, upcoming course(s) a student is/are enrolled in. It
could be any course(s), PC 101, PC 102, or PC 103.

In this student's case, the ENROLLMENT tab shows he is enrolled in PC 103 and a
certificate course for Winter 2023.

Now click the FINANCE tab.

Our student shows a BALANCE DUE of $236.99. This is the charge for the 103 and
certificate course enrollment. He should withdraw from Pathwayconnect so his
balance will drop to zero. This will remove the outstanding balance as he
applies to matriculate.
