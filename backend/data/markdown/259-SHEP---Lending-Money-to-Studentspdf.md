# Lending Money To Students

Occasionally students in Pathwayconnect may approach you or other students in the gathering. They may request a loan for tuition or materials such as computers to either continue in the program or to be more successful. Lending money to a student is strongly discouraged for several reasons.

## Repercussions of Non-Payment

Feelings of guilt or remorse on the part of the lender or recipient are inevitable even if the student defaults on re-payment and the lender changes the nature of the loan to a donation.

## Setting a Precedent

Lending money to any student can set up a pattern of other students going to you for loans. Other students may see you as an avenue for avoiding the stress associated with paying for tuition. It may not create a hardship on you to help one student, but you may find it difficult to assist more than one.

> "If we increase our dependence on anything or anyone except the Lord, we will find an immediate decrease in our freedom to act. As President Heber J. Grant declared, 'Nothing destroys the individuality of a man, a woman, or a child as much as the failure to be self-reliant.'"
> \- L. Tom Perry, "Becoming Self-Reliant," Ensign, Nov. 1991, 64-65

## Self-Reliance

A primary goal of Pathwayconnect is to allow students to develop self-reliance habits.

- Self-reliance habits will aid students in future educational pursuits and life experiences.
- You can encourage students to pursue other ways to meet the tuition requirement. You can Remind, Refer, Contact, and Encourage.

## Remind

- Remind students of possible scholarships they may not have pursued (i.e., Heber J Grant Scholarship, Returned Missionary Scholarship, their employer, and area-specific scholarships).

## Refer

- Refer students to the financial aid webpage.

## Contact

- Have them contact their Mentor for any scholarships the Mentor can assist with.
- Encourage them to contact their mentor for a tuition waiver (see KA-01368). A student can potentially petition and be considered for a tuition waiver if they experienced an extenuating circumstance that prevented them from paying their tuition.

# Encourage

- Encourage them to explore family and church resources for assistance

# Lending Money To Students

Assisting the student to find a solution allows the student to keep their dignity, learn the value of self-reliance, and enjoy a continuing good relationship with their missionaries and fellow students.
