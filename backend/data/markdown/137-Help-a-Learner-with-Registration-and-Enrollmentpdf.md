- **WHY WOULD A LEARNER BE TOLD THEY ARE INELIGIBLE?**
Learners may be ineligible because:
- Their country doesn't allow enrollment.
- They have a low ELA score. If this is the case, encourage the learner to find an English 1 or 2 course.
- Exams can be retaken in 30 days.

## Register For Next Term

- **WHEN TO REGISTER?**
Learners who want to register for the next term may do so during the current term as soon as the Register for Courses button appears in the upper-left portion of their learner portal. However, they typically are not added to the next term's groups until a few days after the current term ends.
Search Missionary Services for How Learners Re-Enroll for the steps to register for the next term.

- **A LEARNER NOT ENROLLED AND NOT REGISTERED IS LISTED IN A GATHERING FOR NEXT TERM.**
The learner is likely a previous EC3 learner who took a term or more off and then came back. They are likely on a list of returning learners to be manually enrolled after the current term ends.

## Tuition

**WHY CAN'T I PAY MY EC3 TUITION?**
- Learners will need to wait until the term starts to pay.

Some learners neglect to fill in the amount they want to pay.

- Have the learner try to pay their tuition in an incognito window if the problem persists after the term starts and the amount is filled.

## PAST DUE BALANCES

Why are past due balances written off sometimes reinstated?

When a learner who had a balance that had previously been written off tries to re-enroll, the system will reinstate their past due balances.

Have ACM write a ticket if the learner showed he withdrew in time to avoid charges, but PATH shows tuition owed.
