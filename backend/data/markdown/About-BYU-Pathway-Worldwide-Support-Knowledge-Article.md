| On February 7, 2017, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\-day Saints announced the creation of a new organization within the Church Educational System (CES) called BYU\-Pathway Worldwide, with the current PathwayConnect program (formerly called Pathway) being one of its core programs. The institution will also have responsibility for all online certificate and degree programs offered by the Church Educational System (CES).  The intent of BYU Pathway Worldwide is to remove barriers to attending college and encourage prospective students to continue their education from afar at reduced tuition costs.   You can find more information about BYU\-Pathway Worldwide by going to the [BYU\-Pathway Worldwide website](https://www.byupathway.org/) or the [BYU\-Pathway Worldwide Newsroom](https://pathwaynewsroom.org/). |
