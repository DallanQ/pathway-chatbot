**1\. Making Payments**


| **Information** |
| --- |
| Tuition is due on or before the first day of every term. You can only pay for one term at a time. PathwayConnect does **not** offer payment plans, however, you may make multiple payments throughout the semester.You will not be able to register for the next term, be eligible to matriculate to the Online Program or receive a PathwayConnect Completion Certificate until the previous term is paid in full. You must be current for all past terms. To pay PathwayConnect tuition, you should do the following: 1\. Sign in to your [student portal](http://www.byupathway.org) (or use the direct link to the [tuition payment tool](https://path.byupathway.org/portal/home/payments)). 2\. In the student portal, click the “Finances” menu at the top of the screen, and select “Make a Payment” 3\. Indicate the amount to pay and select the payment method. You will be taken to a new web page to finalize payment. **Helpful tips:** when entering a payment amount, do not use a currency symbol. The student portal has been newly formatted where you only need to type in the numbers of your specified amount for payment and the system will automatically format the indicated amount for you (no commas or periods are needed). For additional information and detailed instructions on how to make a tuition payment, please refer to this tutorial: [How to Pay Tuition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dxE9T9CNyT-KJzO16zZD_VfIdMF1CpVJ/view?usp=sharing).\*Students in Mexico \& Europe have a VAT or IVA tax that is included in their tuition price. |

The student donates the tuition to the organization; the organization should give them a receipt or proof of payment. [https://www.feyalegria.org/venezuela/donar/](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.feyalegria.org%2Fvenezuela%2Fdonar%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cadavidso%40byupathway.org%7Cebc35e221706436ee42808dc21e393ad%7C61e6eeb35fd74aaaae3c61e8deb09b79%7C0%7C0%7C638422508527703655%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=jDKCYjvaUrc7bP1JEKpWMfOVGWRv0BZERmj8kwPmqu4%3D&reserved=0 "https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.feyalegria.org%2fvenezuela%2fdonar%2f&data=05%7c02%7cadavidso%40byupathway.org%7cebc35e221706436ee42808dc21e393ad%7c61e6eeb35fd74aaaae3c61e8deb09b79%7c0%7c0%7c638422508527703655%7cunknown%7ctwfpbgzsb3d8eyjwijoimc4wljawmdailcjqijoiv2lumziilcjbtii6ik1hawwilcjxvci6mn0%3d%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=jdkcyjvaurc7bp1jekpwmfovgwrv0bzermj8kwpmqu4%3d&reserved=0") 2\. The student scans the receipt and sends it to [Finance\-pw@byupathway.org](mailto:Finance-pw@byupathway.org "mailto:finance-pw@byupathway.org"). The student includes his or her name, student ID, and the classes they “paid” for.  3\. We would manually credit the student account; if the payment is for matriculated classes, we would ask BYUI or Ensign to credit the student account. Tuition that is paid to PEF (Perpetual Education Fund) in Venezuela intended for PathwayConnect is **non\-refundable** from the moment it is submitted.***Semester Credit***If you have paid in full for the current semester (you should not pay more than what you currently owe) and decide to withdraw from PathwayConnect, you will receive ***a semester credit on your account***. A semester credit allows you to re\-enroll in the future and complete the semester that was originally paid for without additional cost. You should note that credit cannot be applied to your account without prior proof of payment. If you withdraw on or before day 21 of a semester, you are eligible to receive a full credit to your account. You will have ***one calendar year*** to re\-enroll in PathwayConnect and use the semester credit on your account.You should reach out to the PEF in Venezuela directly and inquire about receiving a copy of their Tuition Disclosure Statement. |
