**1\. ENR (Ecclesiastical Endorsement)**


| (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Ensign Information |
| --- |
| ***CONTINUING ECCLESIASTICAL ENDORSEMENT HOLD: Online Option*** For Continuing Ecclesiastical Endorsements, you will need to work with LDS leadership and this email needs to come directly from the priesthood leader and not from you.  In your applicant endorsement, your first interview can be with your own clergy if you desire, however that is not currently the case for continuing endorsements.   If your leader can work through the current system, they should do so. You should click on this link: [https://www.ensign.edu/continuing\-endorsement](https://www.ensign.edu/continuing-endorsement) * Click on "online endorsement" * Click "Student" * Click "CONTINUING/CURRENTLY ENROLLED" * Click on the Ensign College Icon * Fill out the form  International students should try the online option first to fill out the Endorsement. If the online option is not available or does not work for you, you may use the paper option.For the paper option, Ensign College requests that the Bishop mail the Endorsement to them (mailing address is included in the endorsement page: [https://www.ensign.edu/continuing\-endorsement](https://www.ensign.edu/continuing-endorsement "https://www.ensign.edu/continuing-endorsement") ) in a sealed envelope. ***ECCLESIASTICAL ENDORSEMENT HOLD: Paper Option*** **You must provide a valid Ecclesiastical Endorsement to be able to enroll.
