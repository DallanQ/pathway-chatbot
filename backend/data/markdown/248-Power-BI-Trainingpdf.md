## How to Use Reports: Menus and Controls

The sections below cover basic menus and controls in Power BI that you can use to make reports more effective.

### Date Updated

The reports in Power BI are updated at different times, so it is important to always check the Date Updated field.

The date updated field is located at the top of every report (1). Click on the arrow (2) to see more information.

### View Options

You can change the view options in Power BI.

- Full screen: Makes the report take up your full screen and hides the filter controls
- Fit to page: Fits the report to the size of your screen
- Fit to width: Makes the report fill the width of the middle panel without hiding the filters (Note: Some missionaries prefer this view.)
- Actual size: Expands the report size

*Note: Explore these view options to find one that works best for your screen size and resolution.*

### Resizing a Column to See More Information

In many reports in Power BI, you can resize the columns if the information is cut off.

1. Hover over the edge of a column heading until you see the Expanding Icon (â–¡)
2. Click and hold your mouse.
3. Drag the column to the desired width.
4. Release the click on your mouse.

### Filters

Just like in Excel, you can filter the reports in Power BI. You will usually use the Filters panel to do this. The Filters panel is located on the right-hand side of your screen. The order of the filters on the panel may be different for each report, but the filters function the same in every report. Normally, you will only need to use the Area filter.

1. Find the item that you want to filter by (in this example, I choose the Area).
2. Select the checkbox for the area(s) you want to have shown in the report. The dashboard will automatically update in a few.

# Filters

- Uncheck the box or click the eraser icon to clear the Filters.

## Exporting Data to Excel

Most data in the tables in Power BI can be exported to an Excel file.

1. Hover your mouse over the table you want to export. A group of icons will appear above the upper right-hand corner of the table.

2. Click the ellipses ( ).

3. In The Drop-Down List, Click Export Data.

4. A pop-up box will appear. Click the yellow Export Button.

5. Choose where to save the Excel file.

Note: Many ACMs save files on their BYU- Pathway Sharepoint folder instead of on their own computer. This will allow you to easily share the report with your Area Manager.

# Sorting a Report by a Column

In many of the reports on Power BI, you can sort by the values in a specific column. This is useful, for example, if you want to see all students who fall under a certain status.

1. Click the column heading to sort the report by That Column.

Note: The functionality to sort by a column is not available in all reports. Any column heading with a little triangle in the bottom left-hand corner can be sorted in Power BI. If you find a column that you aren't able to sort, you can always export the data to Excel and sort it there.

# Current Enrollment

This tab shows information about students who are currently enrolled in or completing the application for Pathwayconnect. There is a tab for each semester in the left panel.

Current Enrollment: Watch this video for an overview of this section.

## Dashboard View

1. Contact Info: Students who added contact info to the application.

2. Modules: Students who haven't completed the modules on the student profile page in PATH.

3. English Exam: Students who have not completed the English Exam.

4. Choosing Location: Students who have not yet chosen their location.

# In Power BI, scroll down to see a spreadsheet view of the same information.

**Spreadsheet View**
Click on the plus icon ( ) next to an area to see all locations in an area.

You can export this data using the instructions Exporting Data to Excel.
Note: The data in the exported file is sorted differently than in this report.

In Power BI, scroll down to see enrollment this year compared to last year.

**Comparison with Previous Year**
Move your cursor along the graph to see a pop-up box with more information for enrollment throughout the year.
Note: Budget signifies the projected enrollment numbers.

## Church Unit Participation

**Unit Participation Tab**
This report shows all the coordinating councils with number of enrollments for the past 4 years. You can drill down to the stake and ward levels.

**Purpose:**
This report shows historical enrollment to help you identify areas of strength, where there has been much activity with BYU-Pathway, and areas where not many students are enrolling in BYU-Pathway. The table on the left is probably the most useful to ACMs.

## Church Unit Participation: Watch This Video For An Overview Of This Section.

1. Select the area from the menu at the top of the screen instead of from the Filters panel.
2. Click the plus next to a Coordinating Council to see a breakdown of stakes within that council. Click the plus next to a stake to see a further breakdown at the ward level.
Note: The information from these tables can be downloaded to an Excel file as in other tables. (See Exporting Data to Excel.)

**Field Support Reports**
When you click Field Support Reports on the Power BI menu, a new tab will open. In this tab, there will be a new menu of options. Two helpful reports are Group Info and Active Missionaries Report. ACMs may explore other reports to see whether they are helpful for their areas.

**Group Info Tab**
This report shows information for all the current Pathwayconnect and Englishconnect groups. This information can be sorted by Location, Student Type (Language/Standard/ EC3), Missionaries, etc. Remember to use the Filters Panel to only show data from your area.

## Group Info: Watch This Video For An Overview Of This Section.

Note: The ESL column shows the number of students in Pathwayconnect Language programs.

**Active Missionaries Report Tab**
The Active Missionaries Tab shows a list of missionaries for your area with contact information, PATH service begin and end dates, and other information for each missionary.

# Active Missionaries
Watch this video for an overview of this section.

To download this report:
1. Click one of the **Missionary'S Names**.
2. Click the ellipses at the top right of the table to export the file. (See Exporting Data to Excel.)

## Contact Lists
When you click Contact List on the Power BI menu, a new tab will open. In this tab, there will be a new menu of options, including Contact Lists and Online Application.

### Contact Lists
This table provides contact information and statuses of every Pathwayconnect applicant from the beginning of an application through enrollment, including what is missing before the applicant can enroll (ELA, scores, accept, admission offer, etc).

**Purpose:** This report allows missionaries to contact students to answer questions (i.e., finances or gathering time flexibility), and encourage them to complete the application, accept their admission offer, or withdraw.

**Contact Lists:** Watch this video for an overview of this section.
1. Click Contact Lists.
2. Click the semester.

*Note:* If this report doesn't match the Current Enrollment report, the reports were potentially generated at different times. Always check the date updated.

### Online Application
This report shows students who have begun applying for the online certificates and degrees program along with those who have been accepted into, have accepted or declined an offer, or have been denied admission to that program. This report also shows students currently enrolled in PC 103 who haven't started the application. (These students have an App Status of "Not Started.")

**Purpose:** This report will be valuable to Specialists and ACMs to see the application status of Pathwayconnect students applying to the online certificates and degrees program.

1. Click Online Application.
2. Use the Filters panel to show only your area.
