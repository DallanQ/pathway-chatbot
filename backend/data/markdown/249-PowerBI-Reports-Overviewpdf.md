# Reports Overview Power Bi

## Reports Overview

### WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?
Field Operations employees and Area Coordination Missionaries

### PURPOSE:
This article will define what Power BI is, who has access, where it gets its data, and what types of reports can be found in the system.

## WHAT IS POWER BI?
Power BI is data visualization and reporting software. You can build reports, filter data, and export data to an Excel spreadsheet. Power BI is a Microsoft product and can be accessed through Microsoft Office 365.

### WHO HAS ACCESS?
BYU-Pathway employees and missionaries assigned to the home office have a license for Power BI. Licenses for new missionaries can be requested through Missionary Support. There is a cost associated with each Power BI license, which is why access is limited.

## WHERE DOES POWER BI GET ITS DATA?
Power BI pulls data from PATH to build the reports.

It is important to note that there is no connection with the SMMS system for missionary reports in Power BI. Missionary dashboards and reports are pulled and built from PATH data.

### EXAMPLES OF PATH DATA FOUND IN POWER BI
- New Applications for PC and EC3
- Student enrollment status
- Student lists
- Auto-drop lists
- Missionaries lists in your area(s).
- The status of HJG applications for your area(s).
- Group assignments and information
- Failed ELA Scores
