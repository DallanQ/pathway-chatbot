# Sunday Visits With Language Wards Increase Awareness About Byu-Pathway

## Visiting Language Wards And Branches (Non-English Speaking Units)

This training is a supplement to the document Sunday Visits to Wards and Stakes. Good things happen when visiting language wards. You don't need to know the language or culture.
