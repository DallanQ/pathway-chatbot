# Byu-Pathway In 7-10 Minutes Increasing Awareness

## Presentation In 7-10 Minutes

Remember, you are united with leaders and members by your love of God and His children. You can count on His power and revelation as you communicate how BYU-Pathway will bless lives. Prayerfully consider experiences and student stories that will inspire those listening.

Consider leaving attendees with brochures, handouts, or a link to the BYU-Pathway website. Invite your listeners to share BYU-Pathway with family, friends, or other leaders.

## Tips For Your Presentation:

- Begin with a brief story or thought to grab interest. What will impact your listeners the most? What will invite the Spirit?
- Share what BYU-Pathway is in 30 seconds and where can listeners learn more.
- Share stories that emphasize those who need BYU-Pathway and resemble the needs of those in your ward and stake. Ask your zone or district leader for additional stories if needed.
- Share a few key points from the BYU-Pathway brochure.
- Ask a student to share a brief testimony or record one to share.
- Offer to stay after to answer questions.
