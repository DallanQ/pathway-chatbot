5\. Gatherings
==============




---






Weekly gatherings are a vital component of the PathwayConnect program. The gatherings help students plant the gospel deep in their hearts, build meaningful relationships, deepen learning, gain leadership skills, improve their English abilities, and prepare for further education.



During PathwayConnect, students participate in one or two required gatherings (depending on a studentâ€™s group type) [(see Section 4\.2\.1 Group Types)](http://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/4-sites-and-groups/groups/#types). Students come having completed course assignments online and are ready to actively participate in collaborative discussion and learning activities.
