### Low\-cost

Pay less for your degree
------------------------

[Tuition prices](https://www.byupathway.edu/tuition) are *significantly less* than other schools, thanks in large part to support provided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\-day Saints.  






### Certificate First

Get a better job — before graduating
------------------------------------












Wish you could get a better job *before* finishing your degree? Now you can!

Through our [certificate\-first approach](https://www.byupathway.edu/degrees/degree-options), you'll earn three certificates on the way to your bachelor's degree. **Each certificate takes one year or less to complete** and can be used to get a better job faster.


















### Courses

 Interactive and spiritual
-------------------------

Throughout gospel\-based courses, **you will be actively engaged in the learning process** as you participate in collaborative discussions and activities with other students from around the world. Courses incorporate gospel principles with assignments due each week, helping you pace yourself.



















> The biggest reason I got the certificate was to show progress toward my degree within my resume. Showing that progress helped me get an internship and a better job.

### The Preferred Path

A great start to your degree
----------------------------

Most students start their degree through [PathwayConnect](https://www.byupathway.edu/pathwayconnect), which includes foundational academic and religion courses that help students see increased success. But the *best* part about starting with PathwayConnect is that you will pay a [significantly reduced cost](https://www.byupathway.edu/tuition) for your *entire* degree program!
