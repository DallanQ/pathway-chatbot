**2\. Instructor Grievance**

| You may contact us with a complaint. This could be in regard to cheating, harassment, as well as other things. |
| (BYU Pathway Worldwide Online) Ensign Information |
| There may be an occasion when you may feel your work has been evaluated unfairly or inadequately by an instructor.  Instructors aim to respond to student messages within 24 hours (weekends not included). If an instructor takes longer than this, Peer Mentors may assist in aiding you in filing an instructor grievance especially if instructor unresponsiveness is a recurring issue. You must initiate the grievance with the instructor within 30 calendar days from the last day of the semester in which the alleged unfair or inadequate evaluation took place.  If you bring the grievance to the attention of the instructor and it is not resolved to your satisfaction, or if you feel strongly the instructor will not deal with the grievance fairly, or if the instructor is no longer at the College, you can choose to take the matter to the Program Chair. If you do not communicate with the instructor, within 30 days, the grievance process cannot advance. At this point, you will have lost your right to appeal any further. |
