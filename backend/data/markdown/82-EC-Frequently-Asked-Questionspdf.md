**HOW LONG ARE EC3 GATHERINGS?**
The agendas are planned for 90 minutes. There should be a lot of discussion time. It is an opportunity for learners to engage in conversation in addition to their independent learning. Discussion and small group time is important for listening, speaking, and negotiating in English.

**HOW DO I PREPARE FOR THE GATHERING?**
- Send reminders for each gathering through Whatsapp, text, or email.
- Send 24 hours ahead of time and then an hour or two before.
- Include the time, place or link, and what they should do to prepare.
- Download and share the weekly presentation. Sharing it as a PDF file may make it work better in all platforms.
- Meet with the lead learner a few days before the gathering.

**HOW DO I SHARE THE LESSON PRESENTATION WITH LEARNERS?**

- Sharing content as a PDF file may make it work better in all platforms.
- Have them magnify into the documents on their phone screen to see them better.
- Remind learners how they should prepare.

**CAN WE USE GAMES TO HELP LEARNING?**
Some lessons have time allotted for games. The lead learner can be encouraged to use any suggested games in the agenda such as two truths and a lie, Pictionary, or word games. Lead learners may decide to use a simple game in other lessons if it is appropriate, accomplishes the discussion goals, and takes the same time as another activity. The point of a game is to talk and share with each other.
