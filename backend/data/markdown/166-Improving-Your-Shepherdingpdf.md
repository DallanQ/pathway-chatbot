## Improving Your Shepherding

### Ministering To Students

As a missionary you are an important minister in the lives of your students. "Ministering is learning of and attending to others' needs. It is doing the Lord's work. When we minister, we are representing Jesus Christ and acting as His agents to watch over, lift, and strengthen those around us".

It is important to evaluate how we are doing in this calling. Let's evaluate three ways we can improve our ministering efforts to students.

### ARE YOU KEEPING YOURSELF SPIRITUALLY PREPARED?

As we need continual inspiration and spiritual guidance as we interact with the students. Let them feel and see the Spirit in your countenance, actions, and conversations. You are representing Jesus Christ.

- Do you have personal and companion prayers asking for guidance, inspiration, and the ability to see the needs of your individual students?
- Are you reading your scriptures? Are you following the "Come Follow Me" reading schedule?
- Do you honor your temple covenants and attend the temple regularly? Do you observe Sunday worship, partaking of the sacrament regularly?

### ARE YOU STAYING IN CONTACT WITH EACH STUDENT?

Elder Neil L. Anderson encouraged us: "Reach out to the youth...Let us think about them, welcome them, embrace them and do everything we can to strengthen their love for the Savior." (CR, April, 2016)

- Have you had a personal, one-on-one introduction interview with each student? If not, can you do it now?
- Do you know your students' names and use them frequently during gatherings?
- Do you contact students during the week when you see a need?
- If a student is thinking of withdrawing, do you know how to approach them?
- If a student misses a gathering, do you contact them after the gathering?
- Are you monitoring students' data on PATH to note patterns that might suggest a developing need?

### ARE YOU PREPARING/CONDUCTING THE GATHERING PROPERLY?

- Do you confirm the assignments for the lead and observing students at the end of every gathering?
- Do you check with the lead student during the week to see if they need any help in their preparation, technical or otherwise?

**Meeting Preparation Checklist**

- Do you prepare the meeting room (physical or virtual) well enough in advance to reduce the chance of a last-minute crisis?

- Do you read the gathering agenda for the week? Would you be able to lead/facilitate if the lead student doesn't show up, or to help a bit if he or she falters?

- Do you watch who participates and who does not so that you can encourage those who haven't contributed?

- Do you hold follow-up interviews with the lead and observing student?
