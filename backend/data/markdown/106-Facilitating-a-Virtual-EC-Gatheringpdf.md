# Facilitating A Virtual Ec3 Gathering

## Before The Gathering

### Before Learners Join The Meeting

- Open the meeting room 20 minutes early to allow the lead learner time to practice if needed.
- Prepare any Powerpoints or other resources that the lead learner has sent you to present.
- Check your lighting in your video to make sure the learners can see you clearly and that you are centered in the picture on the screen.

### AS LEARNERS JOIN THE MEETING
- Greet learners as they join.
- Check that learners' microphones work.

## Beginning of the Gathering

### Announcements
- Welcome learners and give announcements.

### Opening Hymn/Thought And Opening Prayer
- You can listen to the hymn, sing along with a hymn, or ask a learner to give a spiritual thought.
- Invite someone to give the opening prayer.

### Turn Over To Lead Learner
- Turn the gathering over to the lead learner. Mute your audio when you are not speaking.

## During The Gathering

### Assisting With Technology
- The lead learner will conduct the lesson portion of the gathering.
- You will be on call to assist the lead learner by showing Powerpoints or other resources or by creating breakout rooms for small-group discussions.

### Shepherding Learners
- Be aware of learners who aren't participating and send a message to the lead learner to find a way to invite those learners to participate.
- Reach out to learners who aren't paying attention or who look confused or stressed. The advantage of the virtual gathering is that you can see everyone's faces and determine whether learners are engaged.

## End Of The Gathering

- Close the gathering after the lead learner ends the lesson.

### Closing
- Thank the lead learner and share your testimony of what was taught during the lesson.
- Remind the lead and observing learner for next week.
- Ask someone to give the closing prayer.
- Thank the group for coming and allow the group to chat.

# Observation Feedback Session

- Invite the lead learner(s) and the observing learner(s) to a breakout room.
- Conduct the Post-Gathering Evaluation.
- When the evaluation is complete, exit the breakout room.
- Stay and chat with the learners until they leave or exit the Zoom room and leave it open for learners to chat.
