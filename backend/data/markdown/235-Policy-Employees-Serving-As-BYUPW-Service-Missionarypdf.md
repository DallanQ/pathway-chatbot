#### Policy – Church Employees Serving As Missionaries Assigned To Byu-Pathway

This policy clarifies Church paid employees' ability to serve as BYU-Pathway missionaries.

**Policy:**

- **Byu-Pathway Employees:**
- BYU-Pathway paid employees cannot serve as a full-time or Service Missionary for BYU-Pathway while employed by BYU-Pathway Worldwide. Serving as a missionary at a BYU-Pathway gathering is also not permitted for employees. On rare occasions, it is permissible for an employee to substitute for a gathering if circumstances are such that a missionary is not able to facilitate a gathering. See BYU-Pathway Handbook, Section 5.5 Gathering Standards for details.

- **Other Church employees (not employed with BYU-Pathway):**
- Church paid employees working for Church departments or businesses outside of BYU-Pathway Worldwide may serve as a BYU-Pathway Service Missionary if approved by Human Resources Legal Department and the employee's home department. Such an employee is required to complete a Service Mission application which is to be approved by their bishop, stake president, and their Church Department prior to service. The employee's home department will be notified when the Service Missionary application is approved by the employee's stake president, as part of the regular application process.

- **Instructors, graders, mentors working with BYU-Pathway:**
- Mentors play a vital role in helping students retain in the BYU-Pathway program. Likewise, missionaries, instructors, graders, and BYU-Pathway employees play important roles in the student experience. It is important to maintain clarity between the different roles. Therefore, Mentors are only allowed to be contracted as Mentors. They are not able to hold a dual role of being missionaries assigned to BYU-Pathway, instructors, or graders serving BYU-Pathway students (through BYU-Pathway or third-party companies), or BYU-Pathway employees.
