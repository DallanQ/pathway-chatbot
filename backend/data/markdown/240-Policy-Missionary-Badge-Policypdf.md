### Missionary Badge Policy

Missionaries serving with BYU-Pathway Worldwide include full-time, senior service, and young service missionaries. It is important that all Church approved missionaries serving with BYU-Pathway are issued an approved missionary badge and are encouraged to wear them while serving in their assignment with BYU-Pathway.

- Missionary badges are authorized for official Church missionaries as identified in the Church's Service Missionary Management System (SMMS) system. Individuals not identified in the SMMS system with "active" status do not qualify for a missionary badge. To receive a missionary badge, approved BYU-Pathway missionaries are to complete the missionary name badge request form linked in the new missionary welcome email. The missionary badge will be created and mailed directly to the missionary within 2-8 weeks dependent on the missionary's physical location and the in-country mail services. Full-time missionaries, living away from home, are issued missionary badges by the Missionary Training Center (MTC) or Missionary Department. Young Service Missionaries are issued missionary badges by the Service Mission Office. Missionaries are issued two badges:
- Elders receive a pocket and magnet style badges.
- Sisters receive a magnet and pin style badges.
- On rare occasion, replacement badges may be issued, at the discrepancy of BYU-Pathway Missionary Support, if the original badge has been lost or damaged. Requests for a replacement badge can be made through BYU-Pathway Missionary Support.

- Additional missionary badges are not available. Missionary badges may be printed in the primary language spoken by the missionary. Missionaries are asked to wear their name badge while serving in their BYU-Pathway assignment and while attending Church meetings, events, and other assignments where appropriate.
