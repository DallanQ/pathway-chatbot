# 2023 Ela Replacement Testing Pathwayconnect & Ec3 Application

## Ela Pilot Overview

- The ELA pilot internal to the organization is referred to as the Proficiency Placement System or PPS. Students will see the exam as the ELA.
- The PPS assessment consists of two exams: Writing and Reading.
- Applicants must complete the Writing section before completing the Reading section.
- The PPS can be retaken every 30 days.
- Applicants who take the Writing section of the PPS, but do not complete the Reading section within 30 days will be required to retake the Writing section before they will be permitted to take the Reading section.

- Starting May 10th, the first 300 applicants from either the EC3 or PC application will use the new ELA. The previous ELA will be activated again once the 300 limit has been reached. It is possible the pilot may exceed 300 applicants.
- In previous testing, most users using "pocket WIFI", mobile data, and church WIFI were able to complete the assessment without delays.
- Students will see messaging and notifications that their scores are being processed.
- We can expect a June implementation of the new ELA if the pilot is a success.
