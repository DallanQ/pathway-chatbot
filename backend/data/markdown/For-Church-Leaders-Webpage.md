Using BYU\-Pathway in your ministry
-----------------------------------

BYU\-Pathway Worldwide helps leaders reach those who are struggling spiritually and/or temporally. BYU\-Pathway provides long\-term ministering through fellowshipping and education.









Unemployed or underemployed individuals
BYU\-Pathway can help members earn job\-ready certificates and/or a degree to establish or transition into a career.  
  
“I’ve received blessings from the practical skills learned through BYU‑Pathway. The COVID\-19 pandemic took a heavy toll on the company I worked for, and I was laid off along with many fellow employees. I began looking for a new job. Much to my surprise, one of my course lessons at that time was called “Finding a Better Job,”...I immediately applied the skills I learned and was able to find a great new company to work for.” **Yuki Omine** **\| Japan**





Less active individuals and families
BYU\-Pathway helps less active members reconnect to the gospel and make friends in their area by providing spiritual growth opportunities and fellowshipping.  
  
“I wasn’t an active member when I first heard about PathwayConnect. It was God’s way to find me, His lost sheep. BYU\-Pathway shaped my life. Those three semesters \[in PathwayConnect] were the best times in school I have ever had. I learned so much from my institute classes that I went back to church.” **Lavinia Tafuna \| Tonga**





Young adults
BYU\-Pathway’s gospel\-centered courses and institute requirements can be a source of strength and direction.  
  
*“I’ve never seen anything this powerful in bringing into activity young adults who have wandered away.”* **Stanford Demars, Former Stake President \| United States**  






Returned missionaries
BYU\-Pathway can help returned missionaries continue to be involved in the gospel while getting an education and progressing toward a family and career.  
  
More than 95% of returned missionaries who participate in BYU\-Pathway are still active three years after returning home.  






Recent Converts
Newly baptized members have opportunities to progress and fellowship, making it more likely that they’ll stay active.  






Friends of the Church
Many individuals who are not members of the Church gain a testimony through BYU\-Pathway’s courses and eventually join the Church.





Non\-native English speakers
BYU\-Pathway provides tools for improving English skills and professional communication.





Those who can’t travel to a campus
BYU\-Pathway can be an excellent resource for those who want to start or complete a degree, but can’t attend a Church\-university campus either because of distance, job, family responsibilities, or cost.  
  
"I started BYU\-Pathway the January after my divorce. I managed to work full time as a waitress, homeschool my kids, attend my Pathway meetings, and do well in my classes. My BYU\-Pathway group, and the amazing classes, helped me overcome some of the hardest trials in my life as I adjusted to my new life on my own.” **Dawson Turner \| United States**
