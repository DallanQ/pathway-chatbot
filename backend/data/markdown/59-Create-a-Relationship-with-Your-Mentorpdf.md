# Create A Relationship With Your Mentor Byu-Pathway

## A Relationship With Your Mentor

Each student in Pathwayconnect is assigned a mentor. In general, groups will have one mentor assigned to all students. Mentors have a limit to the number of students in their care. Occasionally, they may get two full groups, but only part of a third group. For this reason, some gathering groups may have two or more mentors covering the group.

We encourage you to communicate with mentors in ways that will benefit students and fit within the role of the mentor.

## Helping Mentors Feel Welcome In The Gathering

Consider connecting with your mentor(s) during the two-week period prior to a new term start as you are having new student interviews.

- Be sure the mentor has your Zoom link or gathering location and is aware of your meeting day and time. Let them know they are welcome to attend anytime the gathering group meets.

- Sharing your contact information with the mentor will allow you and the mentor to answer questions for each other, and to work together toward student success.

- Invite the mentor to attend the first gathering, where they can be introduced to the students. The mentor may be invited to share a spiritual thought, or to model the function of a lead student for the first gathering of a group's first term. Be aware that they may need permission from their supervisor.

- Mentors can explain the extent of their responsibilities to you to help you understand where and how they help students. Remember that anything pertaining to the gathering, including transfers to new groups will be handled by the missionaries.

## Mentor Involvement

- Invite the mentor to take some time in the gathering to answer questions if students in your gathering are having a similar struggle.

- Have the mentor take time during the announcement portion of the gathering to address the issue with the entire group.

- Consider having the mentor send a brief video to answer questions, address an issue, or encourage students if they cannot attend the gathering.
