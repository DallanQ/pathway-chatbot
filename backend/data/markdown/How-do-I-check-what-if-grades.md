What\-If Grades is a function that allows you to see what your grade would be if you changed some individual assignment scores. Using this feature does impact your actual grade.

**Note:** This function is only available on a computer. It is not available using the Canvas App.

**Step 1\.** When you are in the Dashboard page of your course, click Grades located on the left menu. Once you do that, it will take you to the Grades page.












**Step 2\.** You can test a grade in a specific assignment or activity to see how it will reflect on your grade. You can do this by hovering your mouse over the score of a specific assignment until you see a description that says, “Click to test a different score.”












**Step 3\.** Once you click on the score, it will allow you to enter a score to test. Click away to see how the score will affect your grade that is located at the top right corner of your screen.












**Step 4\.** Click the ‘Revert to Actual Score’ button located under total grade to go back to your original scores.
