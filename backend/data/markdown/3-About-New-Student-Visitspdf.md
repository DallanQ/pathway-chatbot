## About New Student Visits

**WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?**
Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, and Zone Leaders

**PURPOSE:**
This article defines the purpose of the new student visit. You will learn best practices for conducting visits, in-person and virtually. You will also learn additional Zoom information to cover with virtual students.

### Purpose of the New Student Visit
Some students may be nervous about the first gathering and have concerns about attending. A visit with that student will help ease fears or concerns they may have. You will also begin a friendship that will help them as they start down their educational journey.

### When Do I Visit with the New Student?
Visits should occur before the start of the term in PC 101. Depending on when you were called, there may not be enough time to meet with every student in your group before the start of the term. Continue to visit each student until all have had a personal visit.

### How Do I Visit with the New Student?
For in-person groups: You may consider visiting with them in their homes or at a church or institute building. You can also use Zoom or another form of video meeting.

For virtual groups: Use Zoom to visit with the students. This will help ensure they can use Zoom and test out their camera and microphone. You may consider using another communication tool popular in your area if students have limited data connections.

### Additional Items To Cover With Virtual Students
**DOWNLOAD ZOOM:**
Ask the students to download the Zoom application to their computer or smart phone. Certain features do not work on the browser version of Zoom, so students need to download the application.

**LEAD STUDENT ACCESS:**
Explain that when it is their turn to be the lead student, they will have access to your Zoom room to practice and test out the Zoom features.
