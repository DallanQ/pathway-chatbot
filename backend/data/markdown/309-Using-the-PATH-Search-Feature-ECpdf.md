# Using The Path Search Feature

## Path For Englishconnect

### Search With Student Or Employee Number

- Type The Id Number And Click Search.

The student or employee will be the only listing in results if the number is correct.

### Use The Categories

Filter by category. Most used filters are Students, Employees, and Unit. Missionaries will be found in Employees.

Units is used to find learners past and present within a ward or stake.

### Tips For Searching

- Entering fewer search terms is better.
- Be sure to use correct spelling, exact numbers, or format.
- Capitalized letters are not needed in searches.

### Search By Church Account Name, Email, Or Phone Number

### What If No Student Or Employee Id Is Available?

- Try searching by church account name and email address if student or employee ID are unknown.
- A student may give you their church account name to help in a search.
- Many students have created new Church accounts with different names. Searching by church account name will show only one account and other searches will be needed if you suspect they have two.
- Church account names are helpful in assigning missionary roles.
- Phone numbers are less successful as phone numbers can be in different formats.

### Search By Telephone Number
