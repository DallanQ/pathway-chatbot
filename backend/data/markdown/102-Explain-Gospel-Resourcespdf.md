# Explain Gospel Resources Byu-Pathway

## Explain Gospel Resources

**WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?** All missionaries assigned to Pathwayconnect or Englishconnect assisting students or learners in a gathering.

**Purpose:** This article will help you connect students or learners with gospel resources to help them as they navigate situations and gospel conversations in their gathering and institute.

Part of your role is making sure that students who are friends of the Church and members do not feel excluded. Help students:

- Understand our core beliefs.
- Find a local Church if they would like to visit.
- Become familiar with the Gospel Library and how to download the mobile app.

If possible, provide friends of the Church with a physical copy of the Book of Mormon.

Explain how prayer is part of the gathering.

- Students may pray their way, or you can show them how members of the Church pray.
- Students may decline to pray if they feel uncomfortable.

Explain the purpose of institute.

- The spiritual benefits.
- The development of new relationships.
- Growth in gospel knowledge.
- Institute classes taken with Pathwayconnect will count as academic credit for BYU-Idaho and Ensign College.

Think of times where the gospel resources have brought you closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and share them with the students.

Encourage them to invite the Holy Ghost into their learning.
