# Building A Community Of Friendship Shepherding/Ministering

You greatly influence the culture that develops in a gathering. The expectations, routines, communication style, and interactions that you establish shape the class culture.

## Building A Community Of Friendship In Gathering Groups

Students who feel cared for and accepted by missionaries and students are more likely to continue and contribute to the gathering.

- You will naturally be promoting a positive gathering culture by following principles taught in your initial training
- You can promote a community of friendship by emphasizing and building on some of those principles

### Promote A Community Of Friendship

You can promote a community of friendship in the gathering by:

- Sharing information about yourself that might be funny or interesting in the first gathering.
- Encouraging each lead student to briefly share interesting facts about themselves and their families before they lead the discussion.
- Designating a time, before you turn the time over to the lead student, for students to share life events as they come up, to celebrate birthdays, etc.
- Attending some of student's life events as invited. Some missionaries have also attended Sunday meetings with students.

### Promote A Community Of Friendship

You can promote a community of friendship in the gathering by:

- Encouraging use of social media for your students to communicate between gatherings. Some prefer a Facebook page, while others prefer Whatsapp or a text group.
- Encouraging students with good ability in math or writing to help those who are struggling. Likewise, those with good computer skills may help those who aren't proficient.
- Encouraging formation of subgroups in PC103 so that those taking the same certificate course can assist each other.

The opportunity to influence a student decreases as the year progresses. You should ensure that a student's first impressions and experiences reflect the desired gathering culture.

## First Contact And New Student Visits

- You can help foster friendship by taking an active interest in your students from the very first time you contact them.
- Obtaining as much information as possible about the student in your first contact will help you understand their challenges, goals, and vision for success.
- Inviting the Spirit to help you establish a friendship with the new student will help you keep the vision of their potential as disciple leaders in future
