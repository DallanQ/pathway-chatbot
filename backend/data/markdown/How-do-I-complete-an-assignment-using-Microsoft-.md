Microsoft 365 is a group of programs that includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

If you do not have a free Microsoft 365 account, you can follow these instructions to get one: [How to Create a Free Microsoft 365 Account](https://resourcecenter.byupathway.org/365account). You do NOT need to buy Microsoft 365\. You can close any pop\-up windows prompting you to purchase the software.

2. Find the file on your computer and rename it so you know it's the right one.
3. Sign in to Microsoft 365 on a web browser.
4. Open OneDrive and upload the file.
5. Open the file in OneDrive.
6. Edit the file. In other words, complete the assignment.
