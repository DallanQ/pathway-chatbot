# Designating Programs As Active Or Hidden Path For Pathwayconnect

## Impacts On Enrollment

There are instances where you need to set a program status to Active (hidden) to prevent further student enrollment during an enrollment period. Leadership will direct you when it is appropriate to do so.

If you have set your programs to Active (hidden), it is important to note that returning students will not be able to enroll if the program is not set back to Active (visible) status. Be sure to set your programs back to Active (visible) status after day 8 of the term. The following instruction will demonstrate this process.

Navigate to the location in which you want to change the program status.

Under the Program tab, scroll down to the BYU- Pathway Worldwide heading. You will see two sections: Upcoming Terms and Current Term. The process for changing the status of a program is the same for both sections.
