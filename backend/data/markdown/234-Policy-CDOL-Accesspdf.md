# Policy: Church Directory Of Organizations And Leaders (Cdol) Access October 25, 2022

The Church Directory of Organizations and Leaders (CDOL) is a Web application that contains information about Church organizations and leaders worldwide. Organization information includes address and contact information as well as information about related units and leaders in the organization. Leader information includes address and contact information as well as information about the leader's calling or position. CDOL helps General Authorities, Church Headquarters personnel, Area administration personnel, and local priesthood leaders worldwide to fulfill their assignments.

## Within BYU-Pathway Worldwide

CDOL access is restricted to authorized users and systems. Missionaries and part-time staff are generally not given access to CDOL.

Requests for CDOL access are to be made through director and vice president level. Upon approval, the director will request proper access through Marc Stewart.

## Rationale:

In relation to Field Operations within BYU-Pathway, the area manager has the responsibility to foster relationships with church organizations and leaders through their assigned area(s). Communication with church organizations and leaders should be fostered through the area manager.

For Field Operation questions regarding CDOL, contact BYU-Pathway Missionary Support at missionary-pw@byupathway.org.
