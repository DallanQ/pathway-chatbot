### Helpful Tips

Here are some tips to help them overcome those fears and take advantage of this great learning opportunity.

# Overview

**HELPFUL TIPS**
- Look at the Preparation section of the lesson plan. It will help you prepare for the lesson.
- Help lead learners become confident by giving them small assignments during the lessons. It is easier for them at first to guide one discussion instead of a whole gathering.
- Give learners time to plan, prepare, and practice before leading a gathering. Schedule a time to go over the lesson with them to answer questions, help with pronunciation of hard words and offer help and encouragement.

- Remind them it's ok to make mistakes and that they should be proud of their ability to communicate in a language that is not their native to them.
- Remind learners to follow the lesson plan. It helps them have structure and know what to do. The Powerpoint slides will help them remember what to do.
- Learners can ask for help but try not to step in unasked or take over.
