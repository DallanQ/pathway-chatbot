# New Student And New Missionary Shepherding

## Growth And Change

As you begin your third term (PC 103), both you and the student have grown and changed. Your students are more confident than the beginners you met several months ago. Study habits have been established and skills have been improved. Students are ready for a new challenge.

You have also grown in your role as a minister. You may have been uncertain about your abilities in the beginning, but you are more confident now. You have formed relationships with the students and helped them get past problems. You have come to love them. You better understand what your students can do. You have invested your service in them and their future.

The progress would surprise you if you could replay a few of your early gatherings and compare them with your most recent gatherings.

At the start of this third term, you and your students know more than when you began. You should all be ready to renew your efforts and continue with determination.

This term will show the love students have for each other. Notice how they encourage each other to succeed and to not give up. They are facing similar fears and trials.

You will find ways to support your students as they make new commitments in the final stage of Pathwayconnect and the beginning of their educational journey.

Your job this term is to support students as they make several life-changing decisions. These decisions are described in more detail in the weeks to come. Briefly, they include:

- Completing PC 103
- Completing the first course in the student's certificate plan
- Completing the religion or institute course
- Completing a career path leading to a bachelor's degree
- Applying to online certificates and degrees (or an alternative)
