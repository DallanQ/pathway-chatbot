# Delayed Access To Microsoft Office Suite Download Updated 7 April 2022

Beginning Spring Semester 2022 (April), students who start Pathwayconnect are unable to access the Microsoft Office Suite download page found on their Pathway Portal until after they reach PC 102 and its auto-drop date, which is Tuesday of Week 3 of the PC 102 term. However, continuing students who started before Spring 2022, will have access to the download page at any time.

Alternatives to Downloaded Microsoft Office:
- The downloaded Microsoft Office Suite does not work on smart phones or other mobile devices like Chromebooks or similar small laptops.
- With more and more students choosing to complete coursework on these smaller devices, the Microsoft download works for fewer and fewer people.

New students needing productivity software like Microsoft Word and Excel are now directed to use a free version of Microsoft 365 by creating an account at [Outlook](https://www.outlook.com). They may alternately create a free Google account at [Google Accounts](https://accounts.google.com/signup). Both sites will grant free access to Microsoft Office products like Word and Excel or Google products like Docs and Sheets. All work in Pathwayconnect may be completed with either of these options. In addition, they both work on mobile devices like smart phones and Chromebooks.

Submitting Work:
- For various reasons, PC 101, PC 102, and PC 103 prohibit students from submitting work via urls (links to assignments done in the cloud).
- Therefore, if students use cloud-based software like Google Docs to complete an assignment, they are instructed to download the assignment to their device as a Microsoft Word file (ending in .doc or .docx). They then upload the file to the assignment page in Canvas.
- The viability of submitting assignments via url is under ongoing review.

Later Access:
- Once students matriculate, they will have access to paid versions of Microsoft 365 through either BYU- Idaho or Ensign College.
