BYU–Hawaii and BYU\-Pathway Worldwide are excited to announce a new partnership that will expand educational options for students in the Pacific Islands, Asia, and the Philippines.

Effective immediately, students who have completed any of [BYU\-Pathway Worldwide’s programs](https://www.byupathway.org/) and desire to earn a degree on campus at BYU–Hawaii will be given priority consideration for admission to BYU–Hawaii as well as its [IWORK](https://financialaid.byuh.edu/iwork) scholarship program. Capacity is limited. Interested students must apply to BYU–Hawaii, but the completion of a BYU\-Pathway Worldwide program fulfills BYU–Hawaii’s admission requirements for academic and English proficiency.

To be eligible, students must have completed (or will have completed by April 2022\) BYU\-Pathway’s foundational PathwayConnect curriculum, and/or a certificate or associate degree through BYU\-Pathway Worldwide.

“BYU–Hawaii has a specific mission to serve the people of the Pacific Islands and Asia,” said John S.K. Kauwe III, president of BYU–Hawaii. “Our partnership with BYU\-Pathway Worldwide will help us further achieve that mission by streamlining admission to BYU–Hawaii, while also allowing students to graduate with less time on campus.”

The option for students to complete their degree online through BYU\-Pathway Worldwide will remain available. However, eligible students who would benefit from a campus experience and/or one of BYU–Hawaii’s 39 bachelor’s degree programs will now have this in\-person option available as well.

This new opportunity for BYU\-Pathway students has the potential to bless many lives. BYU\-Pathway Worldwide served 10,995 students in the Pacific Islands, Asia, and the Philippines through its affiliated programs in 2020 and 2021\.

BYU–Hawaii’s application deadline for spring 2022 (April–June) has been extended to December 1\. Both institutions encourage students who meet the eligibility criteria\* and desire a BYU–Hawaii campus experience to [apply for admission to BYU–Hawaii](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church-education/apply-to-church-schools?lang=eng) by the extended deadline.
