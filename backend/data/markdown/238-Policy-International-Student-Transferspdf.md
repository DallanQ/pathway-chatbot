# Policy: Moving Domestic Students To International/International L Programs
Draft: February 5, 2021

## Pathwayconnect students living in the United States or Canada can not be transferred to PATH "International" or "International L" programs.

**Rationale:** When such students are transferred, they get moved into a section of courses that are taught by an international instructor. The CES Board has approved international instructors the ability to teach international students, therefore students living in the United States or Canada can not be transferred to PATH "International" or "International L" programs.
