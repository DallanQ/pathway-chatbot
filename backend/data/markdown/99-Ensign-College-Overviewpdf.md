## Ensign College Learning Signature

Ensign College courses are designed to put students in environments where they act as agents of their learning.

Students take greater responsibility and control over what, how, and why they learn.

This helps them become capable and trusted individuals through Deep Learning—to know, do, and become—and prepares them to enter the world of work with confidence.

This approach to teaching and learning is called the Learning Signature and has three parts.

## Prepare

# Prepare to Develop and Demonstrate Professional Capabilities

*"...That ye may be prepared in all things" (D&C 88:80)*

## Example – Prepare

Students are asked to "search for and discover" their own reputable resources instead of reading assigned chapters or articles. Then, in a follow-up discussion (online or in-class) they compare what they've found, assess how it informs the topic, and identify patterns or themes they see emerging.

This process requires students to take greater individual responsibility for their learning, and can also reinforce collaborative, peer-to-peer teaching and learning.

## Act

Act as an agent of your learning in immersive environments, resulting in Deep Learning — to know, do, and become.

*"Behold, what desirest thou?" (1 Nephi 11:2)*

## Example – Act

An instructor has her students present regularly in small groups on a given topic. They are given specific learning outcomes and then asked to be responsible not only for "presenting" but also for engaging their peers.

The instructor is always present to answer questions or correct any misunderstandings. The students are tasked with creating an assessment that aligns with the course outcomes.

Students are also asked to create activities where the rest of the class can actively apply what they are learning. In this way, students are placed at the center of the process.

## Demonstrate

Demonstrate how your journey to become a capable and trusted disciple of Jesus Christ has changed and shaped you to embrace future opportunities with confidence, resiliency, and faith.

*"...my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard." (2 Nephi 4:16)*

## Example – Demonstrate

As part of coursework, students listen to several podcasts and then create their own podcast as a summary of other research they've been doing.

When telling prospective employers about their research, they can confidently explain that they have experience in audio editing and production.

## Ensign College – Learning Signature

The Learning Signature supports Ensign College instructors with skills-based instruction to help students transfer classroom learning experiences to workplace readiness.

*"...we need to educate more deeply and more powerfully than we have ever done before or than anyone has ever done before...it only happens through learning that enlightens the mind, deepens spirituality, and strengthens the understanding of the heart."*
