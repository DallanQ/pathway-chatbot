### Shepherding Project Teams

**HOW CAN YOU HELP DURING THE GATHERING WHILE STUDENTS ARE IN GROUPS?**

The gathering has time for group work. You are still an important influence even though students will be in small groups.

- Provide a complete list of everyone so groups can be formed and balanced.
- Visit each group during the gathering to see how the group is working.
- Help groups connect to group members who may not have attended the gathering in a while.

**HOW CAN YOU HELP DURING THE GATHERING WHILE STUDENTS ARE IN GROUPS?**

- Help students who gather virtually to split up into breakout rooms for their weekly group work.
- Guide groups to find answers to their questions about group assignments without giving away the answers.
- Advise groups on best ways to reach out and encourage participation from each other.

### Your Shepherding Role

Group work in the gathering is a significant change, but your shepherding role is still vital. Continue to uplift, support, and encourage students as they work.

It may be tempting for you to teach or provide answers to students who might be struggling. You are encouraged to let students work out issues and concerns among themselves.

If a student is really struggling with a concept, encourage him or her to connect with the instructor or tutoring services before taking an active teaching role. The struggle with concepts is part of the learning experience.

Having students help each other is a key outcome of the term project. Do your best to allow that to happen.

When this happens, students report that the term project is one of the highlights of the course. Many come to love each other even more as they work together.

**Should you sense significant problems however, such as major fighting and bad feelings, follow the Spirit to appropriately help the group find peace.**
