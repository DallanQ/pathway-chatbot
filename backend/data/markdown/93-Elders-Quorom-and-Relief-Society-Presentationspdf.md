# Elders Quorum And Relief Society Presentations Increasing Awareness

## Creating Awareness Of Byu-Pathway

At general conference in April 2018, President Nelson announced that the Relief Society and Elders quorum's have the responsibility to minister to the temporal and spiritual needs of the members of the Church in a higher and holier way.

In 2020, BYU-Pathway Worldwide was added into the Church Handbook as a resource to help stake members provide for temporal needs and build self-reliance.

Service missionaries and Stake Representatives can inform Elders quorum (EQ) and Relief Society (RS) presidents of BYU-Pathway by:
- Sending regular email updates (i.e., Leader updates, webinar, Flyers, Newsletters, etc.).
- Maintaining accurate lists of EQ/RS leaders in your assigned stakes.
- Teaching leaders how to use the Leader and Clerk Resources (LCR) Report to view BYU-Pathway students.

It is important to connect with EQ and RS presidencies to:
- Help them understand the purposes of BYU-Pathway and provide updates.
- Share BYU-Pathway resources.
- Discuss ideas to create awareness (i.e., Ward bulletin announcement, social media posts, Emails, etc.).
- Discuss ideas to find the hidden many (i.e., Counsel about specific individuals and their needs, make visits, invite them to participate, Report back, etc.).
- Review the Church Leaders website for ideas about who to invite.

"If I were a bishop, a Relief Society president or an elders quorum president, I would be very intentional and very purposeful about making it a focal point of my ministry efforts, to be sure I invited every less active and every underemployed member of my flock, to participate in BYU-Pathway, because it will connect them to their Savior, Jesus Christ." - Elder Jonathan S. Schmitt, Nasw Area Seventy

## Presenting To Wards And Stakes

BYU-Pathway missionaries may be invited into a ward or offer to provide local presentations and/or Sunday lessons. Be sure to coordinate with the stake representative in determining how best to execute presentations in the stake.

A few examples of presentations are below:
- A brief announcement in EQ/RS meetings.
- A 7–10-minute presentation in EQ/RS meetings.
- A 20–40-minute lesson (Education presentation) during 2nd, 4th or 5th Sundays.

**Visiting wards to introduce yourselves, connect with ward leaders, leave handouts, or update chapel posters.**

**Promote perspective Student Webinars.**
