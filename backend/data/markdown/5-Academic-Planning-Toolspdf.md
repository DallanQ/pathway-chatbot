**PURPOSE:**
This article introduces resources available to students to plan their courses based on their chosen certificate, degree, or career path. You will learn where to find these tools using the image guides included in the article.

### Academic Planning Tools

Students have a tab in their portal that they can use to help plan their courses as they choose their first certificate course, and then move forward to either BYU-Idaho or Ensign College.

They click on Academic Planning, then select Choose My Career Path in their portal. This tool creates a graduation timeline.

- The Academic Planner starts with recommending courses for the student's first certificate.
- Once a student earns the first certificate, the planner will recommend courses in the second certificate, Associate General Courses, and Cornerstone Religion Courses.
- Next, the planner will recommend courses for the third certificate, remaining religion courses, bachelor's degree general courses, and general elective options.

Another tool students may find useful is found on the BYU-Pathway Worldwide website.
