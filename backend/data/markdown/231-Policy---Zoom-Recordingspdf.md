Zoom is BYU-Pathway Worldwide's solution for facilitating online meetings, trainings, and student gatherings. A record feature of Zoom allows a licensed user to store recordings locally on an individual device or on the Zoom cloud environment. The Zoom cloud storage utility is not intended for permanent or long-term storage of recordings due to the space limitations and storage costs.

## Record Student Gatherings

- Pathwayconnect and Englishconnect students are expected to attend their gatherings in-person or, if the gatherings are virtual, via Zoom.
- Students are to plan their schedule accordingly and make necessary arrangements to attend each gathering.
- The recording of weekly gatherings is not permitted.
- If a student cannot attend a gathering due to illness or another temporary issue, see BYU-Pathway Handbook 5.5.3 Gathering Cancellations, Excusals, and Waivers for details.

## Record Meetings And Trainings:

In some circumstances (outside of student gatherings) it may be appropriate to use the Zoom record function for the purposes of BYU-Pathway trainings, webinars, missionary leadership meetings, and the like.

The storage of such recordings may be saved to the Zoom cloud for 30 days, after which they will automatically be deleted.

Zoom recordings outside of BYU-Pathway Worldwide specific use is not permitted.

To ensure adequate storage to record approved meetings, Zoom cloud recordings stored on the Zoom cloud utility will automatically be deleted 30 days from the record date.

# Guidelines for Recording Video

The following guidelines for recording video are based on privacy and FERPA guidelines:

- At the beginning of each meeting, inform users that the meeting will be recorded.
- Consider the reason for recording the training, webinar, or meeting. Recordings should be intentional, not a default action.
- Record only the portions of the meeting that are most useful.
- Attendees may be more uncomfortable speaking or turning their cameras on while the training, webinar, or meeting is being recorded. Consider pausing the recording during open discussions to encourage participation.
