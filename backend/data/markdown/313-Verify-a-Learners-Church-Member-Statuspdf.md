### Verify A Learner's Membership Status

**WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?**

- Gathering Missionaries

**PURPOSE:**

This article demonstrates where to locate the information to verify a learner's church membership status. It is critical that this information is correct to avoid duplicate accounts and ensure that church members pay the correct amount for tuition.

1. In the Details tab in the Student Information page, verify that a learner's ward and stake are listed if they are a member of the church.

2. A learner may show they are a member but have no ward and stake listed. This is a good indicator that the learner has a duplicate account.
- Contact your zone or district leader to investigate this further.
