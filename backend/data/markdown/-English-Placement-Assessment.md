2\.3 English Placement Assessment
=================================




---






Some individuals may be required to take an English placement assessment as part of their application to PathwayConnect. Individuals will answer a series of screening questions as part of their application, which will determine their need to take the test.



The purpose of this assessment is to determine if applicants understand the English language well enough to be successful in the program and which version of the program they qualify for — [Standard version](http://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/1-background-and-foundation/structure-requirements#version) (for students who are proficient in English) or [L version](http://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/1-background-and-foundation/structure-requirements#version) (for students with intermediate to low English placement).
