# Common Terminology

It will be helpful for you to be familiar with some basic BYU-Pathway terms.

## Area

An area is a geographical area of the world that supports all BYU-Pathway activities within its boundaries. An area is administered by an area manager.

## Area Manager

The area manager oversees all of the BYU-Pathway operations within a Church area. This includes overseeing all BYU-Pathway students, Englishconnect3 learners, and missionaries in the area as well as ensuring that Pathwayconnect and Englishconnect3 gatherings are running well.

## Area Coordination Missionary

An area coordination missionary (ACM) assists the area manager within an area. ACMs are senior missionaries who train and support service missionaries. They may also appoint trainers of missionaries.

## Location

Location is a term used in PATH to identify either groups of learners meeting in a physical place (i.e., a church building) or groups of learners meeting virtually.

## Missionary Support

Area coordination missionaries and zone or district leaders are great resources when questions come up. You can also reach out to missionary support with questions.

## Group/Learner Types

Pathwayconnect learners are often divided into the age groups 18–30 or 31 and over. Typically Englishconnect groups are mixed ages from 11–111. It is recommended that youth 11–18 be grouped in their own group when possible so they can practice with other youth.
