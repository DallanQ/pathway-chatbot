If you have a question about an assignment grade, click into the assignment.

Click on Submission Details in the top right hand corner. 

The right side of the Submission Details page should have feedback comments from your grader. They should have included a link to their "grading questions form." Filling out this form is how you can contact the specific grader that graded your assignment.

Highlight the link address in the comments section, and press Control \+ C to copy it (or Command \+ C if you are on a Mac). You can also right click and select "Copy."

After copying the form link, paste it into a new browser by either pressing Control \+ V (or Command \+ V on a Mac) or by right clicking and selecting "Paste."

Press "enter" or "return" to visit the link. This will take you to a PathwayConnect form that you will fill out to ask your grader a question.

**Note**: If your grader forgot to include a link to their Grading Questions Form, contact your instructor.
