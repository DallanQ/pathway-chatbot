Certain information in the portal cannot be changed by students (such as last name). Students should contact their ward clerk to change this information.

Those who are members of another faith should contact Global Services at 801-240-3500. International numbers can be found on the GSD support page.

You should inform area leaders about student information changes if there is no mentor assigned. Your area leaders can submit a ticket to Enrollment Services to update the information in PATH.

Students who do change personal information through a ward clerk or the GSD should verify with their mentor that their student record has been updated. Have the student provide the following:

- The original information on their account
- The updated information
- BYU-Pathway student ID number

The mentor will send a ticket to Enrollment Services if needed.
