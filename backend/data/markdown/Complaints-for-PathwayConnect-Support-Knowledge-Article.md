**1\. Instructor Grievance \& Appeals Form**


| **Information** |
| --- |
| Grievances:  For instructor complaints, you should first express concerns directly to the instructor. If the situation is not resolved or the instructor is unresponsive, you may fill out the [PathwayConnect Grievance Form](https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/75/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=RVeqAkTWqMA_). (This can also be found in the [student portal](http://www.byupathway.org/), by clicking on the “Resources” tab, finding the “Instructor Problem?” section, and clicking on “More Info”.)   Only students can file an instructor complaint or grievance. This procedure does not allow third parties (i.e. missionaries, parents, spouses, support representatives, etc.) to begin this process on a student's behalf.    Appeals:  Appeals are generally filed if new information is available. The appeal will most likely not be approved if you submit the appeal because you did not like the outcome. Regardless, you are welcome to appeal. The appeal form is provided in the grievance decision email.     Status of Grievances \& Appeals:  If you would like to know the status of your grievance or appeal contact the BYU\-Idaho Support Center. |


**2\. Missionary Complaints**


| **Information** |
| --- |
| If you have a complaint or concern regarding a missionary, you can submit the [Missionary Grievance Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=s-7mYddfqkquPGHo3rCbeV7SJAIyt5RCoX33rppogldURTNHQlJQWExRUjU4REEzM1BRU1BTTTlUOSQlQCN0PWcu).     The form will notify our Missionary Support team, who will then work with area leaders to ensure the issue is resolved. Each complaint will be held in confidence for you and the missionary. |


**3\. Mentor Concerns**


| **Information** |
| --- |
| If you have a concern regarding a mentor, you can submit the [Mentor Concern Form](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=s-7mYddfqkquPGHo3rCbeaID1dln8GhGuLz4AAcf1fFUQVgyVTEwVzZUTkVNTDlLMDg2MUxZTUZLUS4u) This form can also be accessed by signing into the [student portal](http://www.byupathway.org/), clicking on the “Resources” tab, finding the “Peer Mentor Problem?” section, and clicking on “More Info”      Concerns are taken seriously and will be held in confidence. |
