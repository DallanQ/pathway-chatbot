# Stake Bishop Council Meeting Increasing Awareness

## Purpose Of The Meeting

The stake bishops' council meeting is typically held quarterly and is led by a bishop assigned by the stake president to plan and organize the meeting. All bishops and branch presidents in the stake are invited. One of the purposes of this meeting is to exchange ideas, experiences, and resources for addressing members' temporal and emotional needs.

### Addressing Temporal And Emotional Need

The bishop organizing this meeting is often looking for church resources to be highlighted. BYU-Pathway is listed in the church handbook 22.13 as a resource to help members with such needs. A 15-minute training on BYU-Pathway Worldwide offerings, including how that could bless their members with temporal and emotional needs, would be appreciated.

## Training Resource

A wonderful resource for training bishops is the For Church Leaders page found on the BYUPathway.edu website.
