# Presenting At Ward And Stake Council Increasing Awareness

## Ward And Stake Council

Ward and stake council meetings are great for sharing the benefits of BYU-Pathway and how it can help the individuals in each of the council member's stewardship.

Ask bishops and stake presidents for permission to present at their council meeting to share information.

## Presenting Tips

When sharing information about BYU-Pathway:
- Be engaging, accurate, and respectful of time when you present.
- Consider asking council members to write down any person that comes to mind during the presentation â€” the Lord will inspire them as a leader.
- Highlight BYU-Pathway's key points, advantages, and blessings.
- Share a success story or video.
- Leave a council meeting with at least two things: a list and a plan of action.
- Pass around handouts during the presentation that include your contact.
- Encourage council members to take a picture of the handout with their phone for keeping and sharing.
