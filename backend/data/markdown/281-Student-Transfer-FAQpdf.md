## Student Transfer FAQ

- What if the Student requesting the transfer hasn't moved to the new location yet?

Generally, if a student is moving to a new in-person location, they should NOT be transferred to that location until they live there. If they will be moving to a virtual group, it is advantageous to put them in that group right away. This will help 102 groups as they create groups for group projects and allows students to bond and begin working together.

- What about students who request a new gathering time but are not moving?

Students have many changes that come into their lives. Change of employment, health or family circumstances may necessitate a change of gathering day or time. Those changes should happen quickly, to ensure that an active student may continue to participate and not fall behind.

- What if the student is not yet enrolled?

If the student is not currently enrolled (if they are just admitted) then you will not be able to transfer the student.
