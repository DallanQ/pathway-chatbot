6\.1 Transcripts
================




---






A transcript permanently keeps track and records the grades students acquire from a higher learning institution. The transcript lists the courses taken and the grades earned in those courses along with an overall grade point average (GPA).



If a student is failing a course during PathwayConnect, it is highly recommended the student withdraw from the course before the withdrawal deadline. [Withdrawing](https://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/3-courses-and-registration/withdrawing/?q=withdraw) from a class protects a student’s PathwayConnect GPA and prevents having a low grade recorded permanently on his or her transcript. If a student withdraws in time, the class will be labeled with a “W” on the school transcript. The “W” indicates that the student dropped the class within the withdrawal deadline, and it will not affect the GPA on the transcript.
