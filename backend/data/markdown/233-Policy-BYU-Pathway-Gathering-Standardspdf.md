### Field Operations

Weekly gatherings are vital to the success of BYU-Pathway Worldwide Pathwayconnect and Englishconnect 3 programs. These gatherings help students strengthen their testimony Jesus Christ, build meaningful relationships, deepen learning, gain leadership skills, and prepare for further education.

To protect students and missionaries, two missionaries should be present during the gathering whether in-person or virtual. If missionaries facilitating a gathering are not husband and wife, they should be the same gender.

Missionaries are expected to attend all gatherings. On rare occasions when missionaries must be absent from a gathering, they should schedule a substitute well in advance. Missionaries are to speak with their zone or district leader for possible substitutes, which may include:

- a current missionary assigned to BYU-Pathway
- an institute instructor
- a former BYU-Pathway student

**For More Information, See:** Byu-Pathway Handbook 5.5.1

In very rare instances, missionaries may need to cancel a gathering due to extreme weather, unsafe situations, or other emergencies. Missionaries should notify their BYU-Pathway area manager if such an emergency occurs.

Missionaries should notify all students in advance, if possible, of any gathering cancellations. Students will not lose attendance points for approved gathering cancellations. In such a rare event, the student completes the attendance report for the week and marks that the gathering was canceled by the missionary. All other assignments for that week must still be completed.

Missionaries at international sites may cancel gatherings that fall on local national holidays.
