## Purpose
This article provides recommendations on preparing for a gathering if the assigned lead student does not show up. You will learn suggestions for how to be prepared to take over if the lead student does not attend.

You will be expected to take the lead of the gathering and deliver the week's assigned lesson to the best of your ability if the lead student isn't available.

## Consider These Suggestions
- Assign two lead students to work together each week depending on your group size.
- Before each gathering, study the gathering agenda and review the assignments on Canvas to have a better understanding of the students' expectations for the week.
- Contact the lead student several days before the gathering to confirm their attendance and encourage them to review the gathering agenda with time.
- Prompt students to tell you with time if they will not be able to attend the gathering and complete their duties as lead student.
- Work with the observing student and the other students in the group to explain specific assignments and challenging topics to the rest of the group.

> REMEMBER Lead students are expected to come prepared to lead the assigned lesson and encourage all students to participate.

Through your consistent preparation, you can ensure that you will be prepared for each gathering.
