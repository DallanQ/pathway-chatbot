# Certificates in BYU-Pathway Online Programs

This is a presentation about the part that certificates play in earning an associate's or bachelor's degree through BYU-Pathway Online Certificates and Degrees.

This presentation is intended only to give missionaries a general overall view of how certificates combine to create university degrees. It is not intended to replace individual student advising. Please do not share it with students, as they might see it as a blueprint for their individual courses of study. That could mislead them and cause them to make mistakes when choosing classes.

## Understanding Certificates

Let's start by looking at the terms that are often used when talking about certificates. The word **"Certificate"** is used in several different ways in the BYU-Pathway conversation. There is the **Certificate of Completion**, for example, that students receive when they have finished their coursework and met the requirements. That is not the certificate that we will be talking about here.

The certificate that we will be discussing in this presentation is the kind that makes up part of an associate's or bachelor's degree. It consists of approximately 15 credits, usually taught in five, 3-credit classes. It may vary slightly according to the type of certificate. Some certificates have as little as 12 credits and some as many as 16.

## Certificate-First Model

The first term we are going to talk about is **Certificate-First**. It sounds similar to **First Certificate**, but the two terms refer to different things.

Certificate-First is the learning model that BYU-Pathway Online Certificates and Degrees use for associate's and bachelor's degrees. This model focuses on students gaining job-related skills quickly through earning specific certificates. Unlike traditional higher education, in which the first two years are focused on general education, the Certificate-First model enables students to improve their employment quickly.

## Different Types of Certificates

Here are three other terms that sound similar but have different meanings. **First Certificate** and **Gateway Certificate** are the same thing â€“ the first certificate that can be started while a student is in the third semester of Pathwayconnect. An **Introductory Certificate** is like the other two but can't be started while in Pathwayconnect.

It may seem that with the name **"Introductory"**, that all Introductory Certificates can be taken first. In this case, **"Introductory"** means that it contains basic knowledge in a certain area of study. It includes beginning or basic knowledge. The **Advanced Certificates** have the more difficult or higher-level knowledge.

So, Introductory Certificates may include First (Gateway) Certificates, which can be taken while still in Pathwayconnect, or other basic-knowledge certificates, which can be taken as second or third certificates.

Advanced Certificates involve more advanced knowledge and often require a student to have first taken the Introductory Certificate that is a prerequisite. Here are a few examples of Advanced Certificates.

The knowledge in this presentation is taken from the BYU-Pathway website. Here is the URL for this information. We are going to look at how the certificates come together to create an associate's or bachelor's degree.

The first certificate is started while still in Pathwayconnect and continued after matriculation. The details of the individual courses for the certificate can be found in the Degree Planner.

To this, may be added a second certificate, which may be another First (Gateway) Certificate, an Advanced Certificate (if the student has taken the prerequisite).

# Certificate and Degree Requirements at BYU-Idaho

- Two certificates, the PathwayConnect Certificate or another Introductory Certificate, will account for approximately 30 credits out of the 60 required for an associate's degree.
- The remaining 30 credits will consist of 8 credits of religion courses and around 22 credits of general education, electives, and potential internship credits.
- PathwayConnect credits transferred will be considered as electives.
- Religion courses taken for credit during PathwayConnect will also be included.

## Associate Degree Requirements

- To obtain an associate degree, students must complete four religion classes, including:
- Two Cornerstone Classes
- Two Scripture Classes selected from a specified list.
- Taking one religion class each semester during PathwayConnect can result in earning two credits per class for free. Otherwise, tuition will apply at BYU-Idaho.

## General Education Classes

- General education classes for online students at BYU-Idaho are referred to as courses.
- The number of credits required for general education and electives may vary depending on the degree program.
- The following are the requirements for specific associate degrees:
- Associate Degree in Applied Technology
- Associate Degree in Applied Business Management (includes an internship in addition to general education and elective requirements).

## Bachelor's Degree Requirements

- For a bachelor's degree, there is a third certificate, 14 credits of religion, and upper-division courses (300 or 400 level).
- Upper-division courses are more challenging and are typically taken later in the student's academic journey.

## Important Reminders

- Students are advised to visit the website to review their choices and consult the Degree Planner for the necessary courses.

> "Free is better!"

## Gateway Certificates

- The chart displays the First (Gateway) Certificates, indicating that multiple certificates share the same Gateway Course (BUSPC 115).
- This flexibility allows students to use the course to progress towards various Gateway Certificates.
- Even if students switch to a different certificate, the initial course can serve as an elective for an associate or bachelor's degree, regardless of the chosen certificates.
