# Your Role In The Gathering

Generally, your role is to minister to learners, open and close the gathering, train and assist the lead learner, manage the Zoom room, and share your testimony of Jesus Christ.

During the first two weeks of the semester, you will have the chance to guide the gatherings and set the example for future ones. There are general practices that will help you create a successful gathering.

## Follow The Lesson Plan

Each lesson plan has been prepared to support the course. Lead learners should follow the lesson plan closely.

This includes doing the activities as described in the lesson plan, doing them in the order given, and staying within the activity duration times. This will help learners have a similar gathering experience from week to week.

Consider shortening the breakout sessions instead of leaving out an activity if time is a concern.

## Ask Follow-Up Questions

You can be a good example of a lead learner by asking follow-up questions. This helps other learners make connections about what they are learning and why it is important. Ask follow-up questions that go beyond the surface and give the learner time to think.

An example of an effective follow-up question might be "Why do you think that?" or "Why do you feel that way?"

## My Role In The Gathering

Involve Everyone

Some learners like to talk and share with others, others prefer to focus on their own thoughts and think before speaking. Other learners may do both. Lesson plans ask learners to do activities that can help either one.

The lead learner should find ways to involve everyone. Our goal is to help all learners be inspired to prepare, make connections, and communicate what they are learning.
