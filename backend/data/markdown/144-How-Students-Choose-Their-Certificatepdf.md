## Who is this article for?
Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, and Zone Leaders

## Purpose
This article shows how students select or change their certificate course and when they have access to the portal. The image guide will help you understand the process, allowing you to help support students and answer questions.

## Your Role
- Students select their certificate course in their student portal.
- Encourage students to contact their mentor if they need help.

Knowing the certificate course selection process will help you answer student questions as they arise.

In Week 2 of PC 102, students begin the process of selecting a certificate by completing the assignment Certificate Planning & Value of a Degree. They will be guided to Choose My Career Path in the student portal.

Students find a list of available certificates and information about each one. This helps them choose their preferred certificate and save their choice in their portal.

The introductory course for the certificate selected in PC 102 will be displayed in the student portal, along with the cost during registration for PC 103.

Students can change their certificate by clicking Change in the certificate section. The certificate can be changed until the 8th day of PC 103.

## Basic Accounting

*Note:* Be aware that future students, the PC 101 students, and students who have graduated do not have access to the certificate selection tool in the My Career Path portal. This option only becomes available during PC 102.
