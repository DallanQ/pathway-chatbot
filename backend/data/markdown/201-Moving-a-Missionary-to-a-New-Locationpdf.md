# Moving a Missionary to a New Location PATH for Pathwayconnect

## Introduction

Missionaries must be assigned to the location of their assigned group. You cannot assign a missionary to the correct group if the location is incorrect. If a missionary is listed in the wrong location, follow these instructions to change their location.

Note: This task can only be performed by individuals in the following roles: Area Coordination Missionary (ACM) and Area Manager. ACMs fill out a MIF for each new missionary, so misplacement in Path should be rare. However, there are times when it is desirable to move a missionary to a new location.

## How to Check Which Missionaries are in a Location

1. First, search for the location in PATH by clicking in Site/Location Directory.

2. Next, in the Site/Location Directory, select the desired location.

3. Click the Missionaries tab. Note: The missionaries heading shows all missionaries assigned to this location. Select the missionary name in the search results.

4. You may also search by name, employee ID, or by Church username.

Note: Typing in a missionary's name in the search would only be done if you do not know the missionary's current location. Ensure you do not misspell the missionary's name or choose the wrong one with a similar name.

5. Once you've clicked the Missionaries tab, you will enter the Employee Details page. Click Edit next to the missionary's name.

6. This will open the Add/Edit Employee page. Scroll down to the Assignments heading and click + New Assignment on the right-hand side of the page.

7. First, select the assignment (e.g., Service Missionary, Lead Missionary). Then, select an assignment place (the location where the missionary is serving). Finally, click Save.
