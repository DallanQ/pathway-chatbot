# Hardware And Software In Pathwayconnect

**Updated: 24 January 2022**

## Introduction

The ability for students to use a device that can run appropriate software and access the internet is critical for success in online coursework. BYU-Pathway Worldwide is committed to exploring and innovating ways to shape its curriculum to be as accessible as possible across a wide range of devices and software. The information below explains the current limitations.

## Hardware

### "Computers"

The syllabi of Pathwayconnect courses state that students must have consistent access to a computer with a reliable internet connection. Currently, a "computer" is defined as a device that can run a full-feature operating system like Windows or Mac OS. Such operating systems can allow users to download and run software like Microsoft Office. Desktop machines likely fall into the category of "computer," as do laptops that can run full-feature operating systems. Devices that fit this category are also likely to have significant processing power.

### Lighter Devices

Over the past few years, innovations in hardware have brought lighter profile laptops to the market. Originally called "netbooks," these devices today include the popular Chromebook, and their major purpose is to deliver a simpler user experience that focuses on web browsing and basic apps. By cutting out bulky software requirements, trimming hardware components, and by taking advantage of the increasing presence of web-based software, these devices are also inexpensive. However, because they do not run the kind of "full-feature" operating systems mentioned above, they are not able to use the version of Microsoft Office currently offered by Pathwayconnect to eligible students (see "Software" below).

Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets have become more advanced and powerful over the years, but their operating systems also keep them from being able to employ the version of Microsoft Office currently offered by Pathwayconnect to eligible students (see "Software" below).

## Software

### Microsoft

Currently, Pathwayconnect students are freely given licenses to download and use Microsoft Office and the Windows operating system. Office includes Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Courses taken by Pathwayconnect students, including the certificate courses taken alongside PC 103, that require the use of Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, can all be completed using the Microsoft Office download. However, as noted above, this product does not function on mobile devices or "netbooks."

Microsoft 365 (formerly known as Office 365) may also be used to complete these assignments. Microsoft 365 can be used online through a web browser (it is therefore "netbook" friendly), it has associated mobile apps (making it mobile-friendly), and it can also be downloaded to a device. Access to the full version of Microsoft 365 is not given to Pathwayconnect students by BYU-Pathway Worldwide. However, a free, paired-down version can be accessed if students create an account at [https://office.com](https://office.com). This free version of Microsoft 365 is sufficient to accomplish all the tasks required in PC 101, PC 102, and PC 103. However, it may not be enough to accomplish some of the assignments in certain certificate courses taken alongside PC 103. See this article for more information.

### Google

Google produces free productivity software that allows students to perform word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation tasks through the products called Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides. PC 101, PC 102, and PC 103 require students to submit files in Microsoft Office formats, however each of these Google products allows students to download files in those Office formats. Once downloaded to the student's device, the student must then submit the file to the course for grading and feedback.

Pathwayconnect prohibits students from submitting URLs of their assignments for.

## Two Reasons:

- Students may forget to "share" their file to the world, a step needed for the file to be visible to the person doing the grading.

- There is a risk that the students may delete the file from their own Google drive, or alter its sharing permissions such that the grader can no longer access the file.

## Summary

See the chart below for how each version of the software discussed above answers questions related to various hardware and the Pathwayconnect student experience.

- Is it free to Pathwayconnect students?
- Does it work on a "netbook," like Chromebook?
- Does it work on a mobile device? In other words, is there a mobile app for iOS or Android devices?
- Can I complete word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation assignments in PC 101, 102, and 103 with it?
- Can I complete word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation assignments in certificate courses that Pathwayconnect students take?
- Can I edit documents while I am not connected to the internet?
