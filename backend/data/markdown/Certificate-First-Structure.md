Make more money
---------------

Many students **see a boost in their employability after they complete a certificate**, and again after they earn a bachelor's degree.
























Finish a certificate in less than a year
Certificates are typically made up of just five courses and **can be completed in one year or less**, and every course builds directly into a degree.




Customize your degree

Certificates allow you to customize your degree. First, pick a bachelor's degree. Then select three certificates to build that degree. **You'll earn all of this for the same cost and time as one bachelor's degree**!
