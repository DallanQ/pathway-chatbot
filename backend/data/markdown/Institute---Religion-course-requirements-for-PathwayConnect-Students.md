### Institute Course Transfer





If a student successfully completes a Religion course from a Church Educational System (CES) Institute of Religion or other CES School, and it is taken for "CES Transfer" credit, and such credit is noted on an official Institute or University transcript, then the Religion credit earned at a CES Institute of Religion or other CES School will transfer to BYU\-Pathway Worldwide to satisfy religion course credit requirements for the PathwayConnect certificate and all accredited college\-level online courses and programs delivered by BYU\-Idaho and Ensign College through BYU\-Pathway Worldwide. Credits transferred are also subject to meeting the course requirements noted below, unless a substitution is permitted.
