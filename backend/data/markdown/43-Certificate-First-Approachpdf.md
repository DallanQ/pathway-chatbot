### PURPOSE:
This article provides a detailed description of the Certificate-First Approach used by BYU-Pathway Worldwide. It answers the question, "Why is BYU-Pathway Certificate-First?" It also explains how this approach increases a student's ability to get better employment, higher earnings, and continued education.

BYU-Pathway Worldwide provides access to more than 30 high-quality online certificates that build into highly applicable bachelor's degrees.

- TRADITIONAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION
- Terminal certificates immediately improve employment, but they do not build towards degrees.

- TRADITIONAL UNIVERSITY EDUCATION
- General education and prerequisite classes build towards degrees, but they give nothing towards improved employment if the student stops out. Traditional universities hold the job relevant courses until the last 2 years of college.

- BYU-PATHWAY EDUCATION
- Students start with a skills-based certificate made up of five courses.
- BYU-Pathway's gateway certificates combine the best of vocational and university study:
- All the certificates have a job skill that can stand alone to allow immediate job improvement even if a student stops out.
- Certificates build towards degrees. General ed is fixed within the certificate in a practical way. For example, one of the writing assignments is to create a resume.
- Traditional curriculum models trap value in the last year of the bachelor's degree, but BYU-Pathway gives the value early.
- An associate degree is built from a second certificate, plus general education courses.
- A bachelor's degree is built from a third certificate, plus more general education.

## EARNINGS IMPACT
Students have a better chance of gaining employment and of earning more money with each certificate. The certificates build toward the associate degree and then the bachelor's degree. Students' earnings impact increases the moment they earn their first certificate. It continues to increase as they continue through their studies.

## PERSISTENCE
Most students who start college do not finish. Those with student loans, some college, and no degree are at the highest risk for loan default. The lowest income and first-generation groups have the hardest time finishing. These are the groups in greatest danger of wasting money on tuition and getting nothing for it.

## Persistence Research

Our research also shows that the more certificates a student earns, the more likely they are to continue with their education. They enjoy improved employment, and they have more money to continue.

> CONFIDENCE The number one reason students don't go to school is not cost, it's that they don't believe they can do it. BYU-Pathway is designed to build confidence early on.

**GIVE ME 5** After Pathwayconnect, students are encouraged to take 5 classes to get the first certificate towards a better job at higher pay. International students double their income. US students see a 25% increase in income. It also increases full-time employment. During Pathwayconnect, they fill out a plan to determine the 5 courses they will take.

**WHAT DO STUDENTS SAY ABOUT CERTIFICATE-FIRST?** "Many people who drop out early for whatever reason, have nothing to show for their education except the money they are out. If you get a certificate, you are more likely to use your schooling for a job." – Ann

## Certificate First Approach

**WHAT DO STUDENTS SAY ABOUT CERTIFICATE-FIRST?** "For us in Bolivia, certificates are a great blessing, because sometimes we don't have enough money or time for continuing our education but if have a certificate, we can show that we studied in USA. In areas like applied technology is more than enough a certificate for finding out a good job." – Raul

"Some companies will hire you with a certificate in a specific area. And, you can use those courses to continue on to a Bachelors." – Pam

"I dropped out of community college 15 years ago, two semesters before finishing my AA. I have nothing to show for that except a pile of transfer credits that will get me done a smidge faster with my Bachelor's degree at BYUI. You better believe I'm collecting as many certificates as I can along the way, because they are a concrete finished thing that I can put on my resume so that if life explodes again before I finish the long-haul BS program, I'll have something I can lean on to get job with." – Kimi

"We can tell our students that the certificates and degrees we offer lead to jobs."
