Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, and Zone Leaders

**PURPOSE:**
The purpose of this article is to explain the types of accommodations and from whom students may request those accommodations. It also gives you guidance on how to respond to students seeking accommodations.

## BYU-Pathway Worldwide works to provide reasonable assistance to students who need it, but it is not legally required to provide accommodations or assistance to students with disabilities.

Students acknowledge, when they accept their offer of admission, that any assistance they receive may be different from accommodations provided by other institutions.

BYU-Pathway Worldwide is not required to provide students with assistance even if it has given similar forms of assistance in the past.

It is the student's responsibility to request reasonable assistance for a disability. Students can make the request by filling out the Student Wellness Help form.

Requests should be made as soon as possible. New assistance cannot affect past events.

BYU-Pathway Worldwide cannot agree to requests for assistance that would change the essential nature of the program.
