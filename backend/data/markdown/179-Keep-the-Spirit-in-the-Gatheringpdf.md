## WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?
Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, and Zone Leaders

**PURPOSE:** The purpose of this article is to help you keep or lovingly guide students back to the Spirit if they get off track.

## Keep the Spirit in the Gathering

You have had many experiences inviting and keeping the Spirit into different situations.

- The students usually form close bonds.
- It is possible that the easy-going friendships will cause the tone at the gatherings to become more social than spiritual.
- Feeling the Spirit is an important value of BYU-Pathway Worldwide gatherings.
- Please gently influence students back if they get headed in the wrong direction.

### What can you do to maintain the Spirit in the gathering?

1. **Prepare**
- Pray about the needs of the students in the gathering and listen for ideas. Follow through.
- **BE CONSISTENT** Follow the gathering lesson plan of hymn, prayer, and spiritual thought. The planned opening invites the Spirit. Invite students to participate.

### Pray

- Always begin a gathering with an opening prayer and end with a closing prayer.
- The closing prayer is the signal that students can casually chat.
- The closing prayer becomes even more important at the end of a term when students feel more relaxed and comfortable with each other.
- You can gently remind everyone that after the closing prayer, there will be time to chat.

- **TESTIFY** Encourage the bearing of testimonies as the Spirit guides.
- You can bear your testimony at the end of a gathering, perhaps connecting them to an idea expressed in the lesson or a spiritual thought from a general authority.
- In many cases, lead students bear their testimonies at the end of their discussion. That can lead to other students expressing theirs also.

### Lead

- Do not try to join the group as a peer.
- Always maintain your position as an example.

### Respect

- Always address the students with respect, in Christlike ways that recognize their great worth.
- Never do anything to break the Spirit of the meeting, such as rude jokes, nicknames, slang language, or worldly themes.

- **WATCH** Carefully maintain the Spirit. Quickly bring the Spirit back.

### Be Kind Make Corrections In A Gentle Way.

# APPRECIATE

Notice the students' efforts to maintain the Spirit. Let them know you notice by thanking them in the chat or through another kind of message.

## What can you do to maintain the Spirit in the gathering?

- **Teach**
- Teach principles, without putting down a person.

- **Invite**
- You can ask all students to bring the Spirit back into the gathering. Do not correct someone in front of the group. In the case of virtual groups, you may send a personal message on the chat.

## LISTEN

It is rare for a student to become wildly out of hand. You can pull them into a breakout room with just yourself and kindly ask them about their needs. Prayerfully listen to them to try to learn why they are upset.

## Follow-Up

You may follow up with individuals off-line or in-person.
