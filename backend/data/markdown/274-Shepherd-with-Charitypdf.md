## Shepherd With Charity

**WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR?**
Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, and Zone Leaders

**PURPOSE:**
The purpose of this article is to give ideas on ministering efforts to students.

As disciples of Jesus Christ who have been set apart as missionaries, you represent the Savior and take on the responsibility to watch over each student. You are highly skilled at listening to inspiration and shepherding with charity.

## Shepherding With Charity

**LEADERS**
BYU-Pathway seeks to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities. There are many things you can do to help students remain in BYU-Pathway.

**VISITS**
New student visits at the beginning of the term help you get to know your students and how to help them.

**PRAYER**
Seek to see each student as Heavenly Father sees them. Spend time praying about each student's needs. Students appreciate connecting with you on a personal level.

## Heart + Actions

**LOVE IN ACTION**
Heart represents the charity or pure love of Christ you have for your students. Actions represent the duties of your role to ensure students are completing their course assignments.

**CHANGE**
As you try to have a high level of heart and action (the top right of the chart), you will see changes in the lives of your students and within yourself. Listen to the quiet voice of inspiration. Write down the ideas that come to your mind. Feel confident that your prayerful ideas are valid.

## Shepherding With Charity

**EXAMPLES**
Here are a few examples from missionaries. Your efforts will be different, but equally valid.

1. Missionaries and students write a one sentence proverb for the group. It is displayed on a slide as students first enter the weekly gathering. Example: "Jesus blessed, comforted, fasted, forgave, obeyed, prayed, sacrificed, served, taught..... and said, "Follow Me."

2. Missionaries often have personal experiences that help students in life crises. One missionary felt inspired to share words of comfort in a student's first language as well as in English.

3. Some missionaries keep a notebook within reach, to record thoughts as they come. One missionary uses the notebook throughout the term to write down anything that comes up during the gathering about what is going on in students' lives. In this way, the notebook serves to continue the efforts of the new student visit.

## Doctrine And Covenants 21

- That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.
- No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned.
- By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.
- Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.
- The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion.
