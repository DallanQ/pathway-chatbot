# Assigning A Host During A Gathering Zoom

You will often need to assign a lead student, missionary, or another person as a host during the Zoom meeting to access the host control settings.

## Click On Participants In The Meeting Controls

- Open your Zoom desktop app and start the meeting. Be sure the person you will assign as a host has joined the meeting.
- Hover over the name of the person you will assign as a host and click More.
- In the dropdown menu click Make Host.
- Click on Change Host to confirm that you want to make this participant the host.

You will then see that the person you selected has been assigned as the meeting host and now has access to the host control settings for this meeting.
