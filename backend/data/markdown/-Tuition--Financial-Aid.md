2\.4 Tuition \& Financial Aid
=============================




---









---




[2\.4\.1 Tuition Deadline](#2-4-1-tuition-deadline)
---------------------------------------------------




Tuition is due on or before the first day of every semester. Students make tuition payments by signing in to their account at [byupathway.org](https://byupathway.org/).








---




[2\.4\.2 Calculating Tuition](#2-4-2-calculating-tuition)
---------------------------------------------------------




Tuition is calculated based on how many credits a student is registered for per semester. Institute courses are free [(see 6\.3 Credits \& Courses)](https://www.byupathway.edu/policies/handbook/6-3-credits-courses-ed).



The cost per credit varies based on the PathwayConnect version type, country, and membership status. Visit [byupathway.org](https://byupathway.org/) to learn more.








---




[2\.4\.3 Tuition Late Fee](#2-4-3-tuition-late-fee)
---------------------------------------------------




If students do not pay their full tuition by the Monday of the last week of the semester, they will be assessed a 5% late fee on their remaining balance. Students will not be able to register for any future semesters until the debt is paid in its entirety. Students in their final semester should be paid in full before submitting an application to a BYU\-Idaho or Ensign College online degree program. Those who fail to pay will not be eligible for matriculation to any online degree program and will not receive a PathwayConnect completion certificate.








---




[2\.4\.4 Tuition Refunds](#2-4-4-tuition-refunds)
-------------------------------------------------




Students who withdraw from PathwayConnect before Day 22 of the semester will receive a full refund. Students who withdraw after Day 22 and before 60% of the semester has passed will receive a prorated refund. The refund percentage is calculated based on the date the student withdraws. No refund will be issued after 60% of a semester has passed. In addition, BYU\-Pathway Worldwide reserves the right to not grant a refund to a student who is suspended or expelled.

[2\.4\.5 Tuition Discounts](#2-4-5-tuition-discounts)
-----------------------------------------------------




### U.S. Federal Financial Aid

All degree programs serviced by BYU\-Pathway will no longer be eligible for U.S. federal loans or Pell Grants beginning Spring Semester 2024 (Apr.–July). If you are citizen of the United States and are receiving or may be eligible for U.S. federal loans or Pell Grants, you have a few options:
  




* **Remain with BYU\-Pathway as your service provider.** You can switch to the new degree structure, or remain on your current plan. You won’t receive U.S. federal loans or Pell Grants, but there may be other aid available to you.
* **Switch your provider to BYU\-Idaho or Ensign College.** You will remain in the same degree program and continue to receive U.S. federal loans or Pell Grants. If you completed PathwayConnect, you will keep your reduced tuition rate, but you will no longer receive other tuition discounts provided by BYU\-Pathway.


### Tuition Discounts


All BYU\-Pathway students are eligible to receive a [tuition discount](https://www.byupathway.org/hjg-scholarship) of 10, 25, or 50% off their tuition balance (amount based on need). After enrolling, students must complete an interactive lesson in their [student portal](https://path.byupathway.org/portal/home/hjgscholarship) to receive the discount. Students enrolling in an online degree program will need to (1\) apply at the beginning of their program *and* (2\) be registered for courses at least three days before the start of each semester. Students must reapply every two years to keep the discount.



### Returned Missionary Scholarship


Any student who has returned from a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\-day Saints during the past 60 months is eligible for a [25% tuition discount](https://www.byupathway.org/scholarship25) . (This includes missionaries who did not complete their entire mission.) Returned missionaries must also be registered for courses at least three days before the start of each semester.



### Needs\-based Scholarship


Students can work with an assigned [mentor](https://www.byupathway.edu/mentors), who will help determine if the student is eligible for a needs\-based scholarship. (This scholarship is limited to one term during the first year of enrollment.)



### Reduced Tuition


The price of tuition for students who start their degree through BYU\-Pathway Worldwide’s [preferred path](https://www.byupathway.edu/admissions/application-process#preferred-path) (PathwayConnect) is significantly reduced — and you keep the lower cost for your entire degree program! [View tuition rates](https://www.byupathway.edu/tuition) .



### Private Scholarships


Students may search and apply for private scholarships that fit their individual needs and qualifications.



### Perpetual Education Fund (PEF)


International students who are interested in obtaining financial aid from the [PEF](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/self-reliance/pef-perpetual-education-fund) should consult with their local priesthood leaders. PEF guidelines and availability vary by country.
