## 4 October 2022

*Note: This document is not intended to be shared with students. Separate messaging will be directed to those students who are involved. In addition, please do not share this with personnel outside of BYU-Pathway Worldwide.*

Both the block and the Instructional Teams innovations will help more students find success in Pathwayconnect. Look for definitions of these terms in the text below.

## Block

### Time is a Challenge

Many of our students are full-time workers, care for families, carry out church callings, and endure temporal challenges (like unannounced blackouts or slow internet), all factors that limit the amount of weekly time they can spend studying and completing course work. These time limits slow the amount of time it takes for a student to achieve a certificate and ultimately a degree.

### A Slow Path

The average credit load per semester for domestic Pathwayconnect students is approximately six credits, with approximately one third of them taking three or fewer. At the six-credit pace, with no breaks, it will take a student 1.7 years to complete the first certificate, and 7.7 years to complete a bachelor's degree. This is a slow pace.

### A Quicker Way

BYU-Pathway Worldwide would like to help students attain their academic goals faster so they can enjoy the benefits of higher education sooner rather than later. When students take block courses, their pace accelerates while still attaining the same outcomes. Should they continue taking six credits per term (block term), they can finish a first certificate in 1 year, and a bachelor's degree in 4 years. Getting to academic milestones faster helps students find employment gains faster, and it reinforces their hard work in school, which can lead to increased motivation to persist until graduation.

### Block In Pathwayconnect

Blocks are essentially 7-week subdivisions of 14-week semesters. Block 1 happens first, then Block 2.

BYU-Pathway Worldwide finished converting courses to the block schedule, with PC 101 (Block 1 only) and PC 102 (Block 2 only) now tested and going to all new students starting January (Winter) 2023. PC 103 will be on Block 1 for domestic students starting April (Spring) 2023. International students will take PC 103 on the block in a phased approach (see the table below). All certificate courses taken alongside PC 103 will be on Block 1 for all students, domestic or international starting April (Spring) 2023.

This change reduces Pathwayconnect completion time from three to two semesters. During those two semesters, all Pathwayconnect students will take semester-length Institute courses regardless of their age.

Students will move to their online certificates and degree program in the subsequent semester. This will create a break for students between Pathwayconnect and the certificates and degree programs, and the characteristics of that break depend on students being domestic or international as well as when they started Pathwayconnect. See the illustration below.

All block courses, including the certificate courses, have been streamlined. This means that the courses have been redesigned to meet the same outcomes as the fourteen-week courses, but in seven weeks, while still asking the same number of weekly study hours from students per course.

Dates and Deadlines Block terms in Pathwayconnect will come with their own sets of dates and deadlines. This is consistent with universities like BYU-Idaho and Ensign College. Students taking block courses will follow the block dates and deadlines. The visual below illustrates these sets of dates and deadlines. Click

# Block After Matriculation

Certificate and degree courses at BYU-Idaho and Ensign College are currently undergoing streamlining and conversion to block. Many of the introductory certificate courses are complete with more on the way. Eventually, nearly all the courses taken by students will be on the block format. This will significantly reduce the time it takes for students to complete certificates and degrees as long as they continue to take six credits per term, which is the current average student credit load.

## Instructional Teams

**Instructional Teams** is a new kind of instructional model with multiple benefits. In this model, two professionals team up to serve the student: the Team Instructor, and the Team Grader. This model has been tested over the last several semesters and has produced very favorable results for students. All courses offered on the block also use the Instructional Teams model. This includes certificate courses taken before and after Pathwayconnect.

### The Team Instructor

The team instructor's role involves several elements, each focused on helping students succeed in the course. From a logistics side, they shepherd students through the online course to help them know its structure and meet its expectations. Along the way, they inspire, lift, and motivate students to continue along the path. Team instructors also identify gradebook and other trends impeding academic success and conduct targeted outreach to provide instruction to impacted groups and individuals. Their role within the context of the course is focused on building capable learners who are confident in their ability to succeed academically, spiritually, and in life.

### The Team Grader

The team grader's role is to provide students accurate grades and feedback so students know how they are performing and where they can improve. Team graders follow strict policies and procedures while using scoring rubrics and feedback templates to give timely grades and robust feedback on manually graded assignments. They are not assigned to a section of students but instead grade each assignment from the entire pool of students on a first-come basis. This flexibility greatly speeds up the time it takes for students to receive grades and feedback. Should students have a question or concern about their grade on a given assignment, they work with the team grader to clarify scores and feedback as needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Block Curriculum

- When will block begin? See the Block in Pathwayconnect section above.
- Can I see a block course? The preview courses can be found here.
- What about students that started on the semester schedule? These students will continue the semester schedule. Once they matriculate, they can find and enroll in block courses then.
- What about gatherings in PC 103 block and after? Gatherings related to PC 103 are required for all students in PC 103 block while they are taking that course.

Once the course is finished at the end of block 1, students are invited and encouraged to continue gathering as a PC 103 group, but they are no longer required to report those gatherings since the class has ended. Gathering agendas for these optional weeks have been provided to missionary leadership. Continuing to gather can be a way of supporting each other as students' next steps in their certificates and degree programs approach.

When will we see a block PC 103? See the Block in Pathwayconnect section above.

Can a student take another certificate course in the second block after PC 103? Not at this time. In order for that to happen, a student would need to be able to matriculate mid-semester, and that is not currently an option. See the question "Why do we need to have PC 103 and the certificate course in block 1, and then a break?" for more information.

## Why isn't PC 103 Block coming out sooner?

There was a limited pilot of PC 103 block in April of 2022. Pathwayconnect is applying learnings from that pilot to make it ready for a larger student body. In addition, BYU-Idaho and Ensign College need time to finalize all of the certificate courses on the block by April 2023. Finally, since international students are taught by international instructors, extra time is needed to finalize PC 103 for international students.

## Why do we need to have PC 103 and the certificate course in block 1, and then a break?

Pathwayconnect is ever learning about how to optimize the student experience to help meet the mission of BYU-Pathway Worldwide, which is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities. Part of this learning involves preparing for a future where nearly every course students take is a block course. This will help students obtain their education, and find its attendant benefits, faster. It is important therefore to transition to block curriculum when it is ready. Having our students in these courses as soon as possible also helps us continue optimizing them.

The break that naturally occurs after PC 103 and the certificate course will be something we will study. While there are some indications that a break can be beneficial for some students (e.g., longer summer in the northern hemisphere, longer Christmas break), ultimately that break will be temporary. This is because BYU-Pathway Worldwide is striving for a future where we have more than three starts per year whereas right now, systems and processes are not in place to facilitate that. In the meantime, every effort is being taken to assure that students have a great experience today while they pursue their own journeys of discovery and growth.

## Communication

How will block students receive messaging? Email messaging and messages sent through the BYU-Pathway Portal are coordinated around students who pertain to a block PATH program (track). These messages are tailored to the block experience, especially when explaining dates and deadlines.

## Enrollment

How many starts per year will there be with block? Pathwayconnect will continue to start new students in the semesters that begin in January (Winter), April (Spring), and September (Fall). PC 101 will only be taught on Block 1, and PC 102 on Block 2 of each of those semesters. This means that area managers continue to start cohorts in the same three time slots per year. Even though block 2 terms may be visible in PATH to potentially set up new cohorts in Block 2, please do not do this.

## What about returning students?

Returning students will follow the same process they currently do, whether they took semester-length PC 101 or PC 102, or they took older courses such as GS 120. PATH understands the equivalency and prerequisite relationship between older courses and these new block ones and will route students appropriately to the right course. If they need to just take PC 102, they will only be placed into PC 102 for the second block.

## What if a student withdraws?

Students who withdraw will need to wait for another semester to reapply. As noted above, there are still three starts per year.

## Finances

Will students need to pay tuition for PC 101 block before they can move to PC 102? Yes. Because PC 101 is on the block schedule, students will need to pay tuition before the beginning of PC 102 on the second block.

## Missionary

How are gathering groups affected? PC 101 or PC 102 block students should not gather with semester students. There are separate gathering agendas for the block courses. Related gathering materials can be found on the Missionary Services Website [here](link).

Where is the training for missionaries? Missionary training documents will be modified in time for those who are shepherding block students. Missionaries may ask further questions through their leadership channels.

## Instructional Teams

Are graders and instructors assigned to the same gathering group(s)? No. In the traditional arrangement, instructors were not assigned to the same gathering group. This will continue with instructors and graders.

How are graders and instructors assigned to students? Graders work with the pool of all students. They grade each submission from the pool in the order it is submitted. As part of the feedback for each graded assignment, graders give students a link that students can use to contact the grader and discuss the score and/or grader feedback if desired. Instructors are still assigned to a section of students in Canvas. Instructors work with that same section of students during the entire term.

What are the roles for those who regularly work with students? There are at least four roles that support students on a regular basis, and their major duties are illustrated below. It is important to note that if a student expresses a concern about an assignment grade or feedback, that they use the link found in their assignment feedback to clarify with the grader. If they have concerns with the course in general, they should reach out to their instructor. People filling these roles should direct students to the right person, repeatedly as needed, to help students know which role fills which set of needs.
