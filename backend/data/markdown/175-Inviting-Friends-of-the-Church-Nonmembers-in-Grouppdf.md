# Purpose
This training is designed to help you as a Service Missionary invite students in your group who are not members of the Church to learn more about the gospel. This training should not exceed 30 minutes.

## Read
BYU-Pathway is one of the best missionary tools in the Church. Currently, the number of students who are not members of the Church in Pathwayconnect is over 1,000. A majority of these students join Pathwayconnect because of the spiritual component. Recent surveys show that when asked, over 90% of these students accept the invitation to hear the gospel. Roughly 30% of those students are baptized. Surveys also show that less than half of all nonmembers are asked to hear the gospel. Think about the impact if all nonmember students were invited. The Spirit will guide you as you invite students to learn more about the gospel. This training will discuss ideas for starting the conversation.

## Watch
Our invitations should focus on the Savior. To invite, we need to demonstrate love and simply open our mouths.

The Spirit will guide our words when we invite (D&C 33:8-10).

> 8 Open your mouths and they shall be filled, and you shall become even as Nephi of
old, who journeyed from Jerusalem in the Wilderness.
>
> 9 Yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo, I am with you.
>
> 10 Yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled, saying: Repent, repent, and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

## Discuss
What does this passage teach us about proclaiming the gospel? What experiences have you had where the Spirit has given you what to say?

## Read
We may have fears or concerns about inviting students. Surveys show that less than half of the students who are not members of the Church are invited to hear the gospel. While we don't want to put pressure on our students to hear the gospel or join the Church, it is important that they have the opportunity to make covenants with their Savior.
