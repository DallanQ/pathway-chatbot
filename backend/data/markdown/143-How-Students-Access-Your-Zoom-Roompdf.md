# How Students Access Your Zoom Room Zoom

- A student needs to open their student portal and click My Gathering.
- A student will click the Join Virtual Gathering link. Their Zoom app will open and go directly to your gathering's Zoom room.

This is the approved method for students accessing their virtual gatherings. Avoid scheduling Zoom meetings for your gathering. Your Zoom room link needs to be in the Video Conference link field in PATH. Placing the Zoom link in PATH is typically done by a zone or district leader.
