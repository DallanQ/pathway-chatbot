As part of a worldwide Church workforce, missionaries serving with BYU-Pathway represent both the Savior and His Church in countries around the world. Missionaries have the responsibility of helping students develop as disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities.

BYU-Pathway follows the Church's employee and service missionary dress and grooming standards as outlined in Section 2.6 – Dress and Grooming Standards of the Church's General Employment Policies.
