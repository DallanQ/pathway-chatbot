## Companion App Sources

The Companion App is still learning. It draws its answers from support knowledge base articles and the BYU-Pathway website. The knowledge articles are in the process of being developed and edited for Englishconnect 3.

## Ways To Access The Companion App

A student's best access is through the mobile app. To download the mobile app:
- Go to companion.byupathway.org on your Phone's Browser
- Click more at the bottom right of the app.
- Next, Click How To Download The App.

Follow the instructions for either iOS or Android. On some devices you must click on Install App.

Once installed, look for the icon place it where you would like on your home screen.

Another way to access is through the website companion.byupathway.org. Some functions do not work on the web app.

The app can also be accessed through the Learner Portal. Click Need Help in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Instructions for logging in appear in the lower-right corner.

## App Functions

The app keeps a running history of the chats and questions you ask. When the app thinks it answered your question it will add a new action screen, such as the one on the right. Only the most recent blue or white bars will respond if the learner clicks on them. If the app isn't responding, scroll down until the last screen is visible and click on those bars.

To get help, either type help in the Ask a Question button or click Popular Topics, then click Get Help from a Support Agent.

# Submit Feedback At The End Of The Chat
