> ENGLISHCONNECT 3 IS OWNED BY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS

The gatherings have religious studies and discussions. Learners are not expected to join the Church, but all learners must maintain a respectful attitude toward the doctrines, beliefs, and standards of others. Prayer is part of the gathering. Learners may pray in their own way, or we can show how members of the Church pray. If learners are uncomfortable praying, they may decline to do so.

- We will learn English Prayer language.
