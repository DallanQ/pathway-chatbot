**1\. Late Fee Percentage**


| (BYU\-Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University\-Idaho Information |
| --- |
| A one\-time late fee of 5% will be charged to the current semester Tuition balance if not paid in full by the registration deadline ([Financial Aid Dates and Deadlines](http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid/resources/dates-and-deadlines)). The late fee will be placed on your account 7 days after the semester begins. All debts over 30 days past due will also receive a ‘monthly’ 1% service charge on past due debts of $100\.00 or more.* Accounting Services will wait 7 days after the first day of the semester. On the 8th day, a one\-time late fee equaling 5% of the current balance owing will be added to the students past due tuition balance. * Those who submitted their FAFSA and all requested documents by the priority deadlines will receive late fees but may be eligible to have them removed by filling out a waiver request through Accounting Services. These waivers will only be submitted if the student is anticipating receiving and is eligible for financial aid. * Those who miss the priority deadline and do not have other resources to pay their charges will receive a late fee. |

**2\. Remove Holds/Fees**

| You may request to remove late fees or holds only if you are waiting for financial aid, scholarships, and met all of the priority deadlines. If you accepted your loan after the late fee was added, the late fee cannot be waived. If you met the priority deadline, your aid does not cover the full tuition amount, then you are required to pay the difference that your financial aid does not cover.For example, if you were granted 75% of tuition and met the priority deadline, you need to pay the remaining 25% of your tuition to be eligible to receive a late fee waiver. If you do not pay the 25%, you will be charged the late fee/service charges for the entire amount tyou owe rather than the difference. The same applies for Scholarships. |
