**1\. General Information**


| (BYU\-Pathway Worldwide Online) Brigham Young University \- Idaho Information |
| --- |
| You can receive an Academic Planning appointment if you have questions regarding the following:* Graduation Review * Issues with the Degree Planner * Brand New Student * How to Read a Degree Audit * Program Applicability * Looking at other Degree Options  Before you set up an appointment with an academic advisor, ask yourself the following questions:* Am I waiting for any transfer credit to be evaluated? If the answer is yes, we recommend you not schedule an appointment with Academic Planning until it has been evaluated. The transfer evaluation process can take up to 5 weeks once you are accepted to the Online Degree program. Students will receive an e\-mail to their BYU\-Idaho email account from the Transfer Evaluation team * Do I have any holds on my account? If the answer is yes, we recommend having no holds before meeting with Academic Planning  If the answer is NO to both of these questions, you can request an advising appointment by talking to your mentor or submitting a support request in your portal by clicking on “Support.” |
