Questions




What if I have transfer credit? Do I still have to start with a certificate?
Your previous credits will likely transfer as elective credits, which still count toward your eventual bachelor’s degree. If you have previous credits that have a direct equivalent to a required certificate course, you likely won’t need to take that certificate course. If this is your situation, please contact [Pathway Support](https://www.byupathway.edu/student-support) once you’ve applied and been admitted.





How long does it take to complete a certificate program?
Certificates are 12\-15 credits and can be completed in one year or less. Every course in a certificate builds directly into an associate and bachelor’s degree.





Will it take longer or cost more for me to get certificates?
No. Certificates are a more efficient, streamlined approach to obtaining a bachelor’s degree. All certificate courses count toward a bachelor’s degree.
