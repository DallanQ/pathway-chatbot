BYU-Pathway offers a one-year, reduced-cost online program called Pathwayconnect that prepares students to start or finish a degree by building spiritual confidence and teaching foundational academic skills. After Pathwayconnect, students may apply their course credits toward an online degree from BYU-Idaho or Ensign College at the same low tuition price. During Pathwayconnect students complete online coursework and participate in weekly gatherings with other BYU-Pathway students.

Weekly gatherings A missionary's primary assignment is to 1) facilitate weekly gatherings and 2) create awareness of BYU-Pathway within your home stake and surrounding stakes as assigned.

In addition to taking academic and institute courses, students gather once each week at a local institute building, Church meetinghouse, or virtually in online groups where they participate in educational and leadership activities related to their courses, build lifelong friendships, and deepen their testimony of Jesus Christ.

Pathwayconnect gatherings are facilitated by missionaries. Gatherings are typically held on a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
