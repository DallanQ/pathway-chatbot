Gathering Missionaries, District Leaders, And Zone Leaders

### Purpose:

This article demonstrates where to locate a learner's tuition payments and remaining balance.

1. You will find a student's tuition payments and remaining tuition balance in the Finance tab on the Student Information page in PATH.
- You can tell which type of charge a student has by looking in the Description column.

Ask the learner to share their screen in a zoom call with you as they check the Finance tab in their portal if the information you see in the learner's Finance tab seems different than what is expected. Sometimes the view in the learner's portal is simpler and easier to understand. It may clarify what is shown in the Finance tab of the Student Information page in PATH.

You can also ask a district or zone leader to impersonate the learner's portal to check the information against the view in the Finance tab.
