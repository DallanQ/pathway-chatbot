# Restructuring Area Organization In Path Path For Pathwayconnect

## Organization of Sites and Locations in PATH can be changed without disruption

There are many reasons to change your structure in PATH:
- It can be less confusing to have PATH mirror any changes in an **Area Organization**.

- Growth may cause the need to divide into smaller Districts and/or Zones within the area. Zone leaders see their zones more easily when PATH matches the district (Location) structure within the zone (Site).

- Program or curriculum changes may cause a different organization in the area that can be reflected in the PATH organization.

## Changes to mimic Area organization

- Reorganization of any kind should be done in coordination with your area manager.

- The following is a way to reorganize sites and locations in PATH without disrupting gatherings, having to perform mass moves, or creating downtime for leadership accessibility.

## Preparation

### Steps To Prepare For Organization

1. Make a chart of your new organization

2. Look at the current Site/Location Directory (create a copy)

3. Change your Site/Location list to match your new org chart

4. Rename sites and locations in a uniform manner

5. Make the changes in PATH

## Plan

(1) First, make a chart of your new organization:
- Be sure it shows the organization of Zones and **Districts With Leaders**.

(2) Second, Look At The Current Site/Location Directory

(3) Third, make a copy:
- Make a copy of your current PATH Site/location List.

- You may want to take a screen shot or simply copy the list of Sites and Locations.

In our example, the Utah area had 8 Zones.
Zones 1-7 had face-to-face gatherings and Zone 8 had 7 virtual districts with 10-20 gatherings each.
Face-to-face districts were named according to location. The virtual ones according to meeting day/time.

# With the decrease of in-person gatherings it was decided to divide the virtual districts among the seven geographic zones

It was decided to name the zones and districts with the same convention.

All names were prefaced with the area name. This groups all locations together in dropdown lists when choosing student transfers and missionary assignments. This saved time in these processes.

Approving units/stakes for virtual locations may need to be updated so virtual gatherings will limit students to certain geographic areas. See Authorizing Virtual Locations.

## Plan

(4) Change your Copied Site/Location list to match your new org chart Sites are in a bolded blue font. They are zones in the organization. Locations are a lighter blue and are under the locations heading. They are districts. It could be divided so the sites are led by AACMs, making the Locations Zones.

(5) Rename sites and locations in a uniform manner Your naming convention can be either place names or numbers, but it is advantageous to preface all names with a short name common to all such as the area name.

(6) Now you are ready to change your organization in PATH
