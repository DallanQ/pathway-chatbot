### Gatherings With 11–17 Years Old Learners

**BACKGROUND**
In all areas, learners younger than 18 years old can attend Englishconnect 3 gatherings. These learners have special needs and require special permissions to continue in the program. You can see all learners ages as you research their information before the New Learner Visit. Click on the learner's name in your roster to go to Learner Information. The information in the DETAILS tab shows the learner's age.

## Initial Contact

- Make early contact with the young learner.
- Have comprehensive New Learner Visit as outlined in the EC3 New Learner training is especially important for these young learners.
- Meet with them and their parent(s).
- Get to know the learner and their background.
- Let the learner and their parent or guardian know the expectations for success in the program.
- Get a signed Parental Consent Form. It is required before young learners can participate. A link to the form is found on the Missionary Services website. It is available in many languages.

- Or, the young learners can take a screenshot of it on their phone.
- There are free apps that allow drawing or typing on the image before saving. Parents can sign and return it to you as an image or PDF.
- Completed forms must be stored by local leaders and be available for audit.

## New Learner Visit

- Teach how the Englishconnect 3 program is different than what learners may have experienced in Englishconnect 1 and 2. Parents should know:

# Englishconnect 3 Guidelines

- There is a minimal charge for Englishconnect 3.
- Modules are accessed online, and work submitted is evaluated so learners will have some communication with a grader.

## Learner Participation

- Learners are expected to help lead at least one gathering. This may be frightening for younger learners.
- There may be Facebook, Whatsapp, or other communication groups that would need the parent's consent before the learners can participate.
- Other considerations for younger learners:
- They may be attending formal education in addition to Englishconnect and find it challenging to do modules in addition to regular homework and other activities.
- Parents or learners may want to handle any questions about their age and background from other learners in a certain way. You should follow these wishes.

### Ongoing Considerations

- Follow Church policies for protecting youth (which includes participants 18 years old or younger).
- Ensure that at least two responsible adults are present at all times during group meetings.
- Do not work one-on-one with a minor participant in private. You must follow these policies even if the group is meeting virtually.

- Be sure younger learners are in breakout groups with two or more other learners.
- Demonstrate your respect for these learners as they are doing more than most other teenagers.
- Maintain more frequent contact to be sure of their progress and that they feel comfortable in the gathering.

- Be aware that younger learners may need to miss gatherings when they have youth camps or Trek.
- Think of creative suggestions for further education if they become proficient enough in English but are not old enough to continue their education in BYU-Pathway.
