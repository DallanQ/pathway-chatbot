# Byu-Pathway Report For Church Leaders Leader And Clerk Resources

## Why is it important to know about the BYU-Pathway Worldwide report available in Leader and Clerk Resources (LCR)?

BYU-Pathway Worldwide is a powerful ministering tool to increase self-reliance, keep recently-returned missionaries engaged and participating in the gospel, strengthen those who are struggling, bring back less-actives who need additional education, and introduce friends to the Church (see section 22.10.1 of the Church handbook). The report brings to light those within a ward or stake boundary who are participating in BYU-Pathway and could benefit from coordinated ministering efforts.
