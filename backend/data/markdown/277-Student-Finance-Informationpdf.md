# Student Financial Information Path For Pathwayconnect

## Understanding Student Financial Entries

- Students may have questions about their financial transactions.
- Each student has a financial tab in PATH, but the information can be difficult to understand.
- If you have the role to impersonate, looking at a student's financial statement in the student portal will give you a very clear picture.
- If you cannot impersonate, visit with the student through Zoom and have them share their portal screen.

Each student has a finance tab in PATH when you click into a student record. All transactions are shown.

See the student transactions below.

Looking at this view may still leave you with questions.

## Scroll Back To The Top And Click Impersonate User Program Portal.

## Click The Finance Link In The Student Portal.

Three options appear in the dropdown:
1. Make Payment will display charges still owing
2. Finance Statement will show all transactions
3. Heber J. Grant Tuition Discount will show date awarded and discount amount

The Financial Statement page has a listing for each transaction.
