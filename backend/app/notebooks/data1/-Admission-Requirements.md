# 2.2.1 Church Membership Status

PathwayConnect is open to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This includes members who are disfellowshipped or on formal Church probation but excludes individuals who have been excommunicated.*

Individuals who are not members of the Church who have a close tie to the Church are also welcome to apply (See [2.2.2 Non-Member Applicants](https://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/2-admission-and-tuition/admission/#non-member)).

*Priesthood leadership should contact Area Managers to inquire about admission for individuals who have been excommunicated.



# 2.2.2 Non-Member Applicants

BYU-Pathway Worldwide authorizes students who are not members of the Church to participate at any approved PathwayConnect site under the following guidelines:

* Applicants must have a close tie to the Church, such as being in a part-member family or learning about the Church.
* Applicants must meet all other PathwayConnect admission requirements (see [2.2 Admissions Requirements](https://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/2-admission-and-tuition/admission/#top)).
* Each site should not exceed 20 percent non-member enrollment.
* Students who are not Church members will pay 25 percent more for tuition.

# 2.2.3 Minimum Age Eligibility

Applicants who are 17 years old are required to have a high school diploma or equivalent to be admitted to PathwayConnect, while those ages 18+ are not required to have these credentials. Applicants younger than age 17 are not eligible for admission, except in certain international locations.



# 2.2.4 CES Honor Code

Students are encouraged to strive to live the [CES Honor Code](https://www.lds.org/church-education/honor-code?lang=eng) as a matter of principle and to prepare them if they choose to later [continue](http://www.byui.edu/online/certificate-and-degree-programs) to the online degree program from BYU-Idaho and supported by BYU-Pathway, when they will be required to live the [BYU-Idaho Honor Code](http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code). Additionally, since the courses PathwayConnect students take are from BYU-Idaho, principles of academic integrity are strictly enforced [(see 10.1 Honor Code)](http://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/introduction/10-student-honor/honor-code/).



# 2.2.5 Criminal History

Applicants with certain types of criminal history may be excluded from participating in PathwayConnect. Crimes that are violent and/or sexual in nature may require the submission of formal court documentation indicating that all conditions of city, county, state, federal, or international legal requirements and court obligations have been completed.

Applicants who are listed on any type of sex offender registry or who are on probation for or have any other unresolved legal actions relating to crimes that are violent and/or sexual in nature may not be admissible to PathwayConnect. PathwayConnect students with criminal history who plan to continue into the online degree program will need to submit court documentation and may be subject to additional consideration by the BYU-Idaho Admissions Office.

If court documentation is required for a PathwayConnect application, it may be submitted by email at [support@byupathway.org](mailto:support@byupathway.org).



## 2.2.6 Student Visas

PathwayConnect is not a full-time study program; therefore it does not meet any kind of student visa requirements. BYU-Pathway Worldwide will not issue documentation to individuals seeking to obtain a student visa to enroll in the PathwayConnect at a site in the United States.
